  "saints": "1. THE HOLY APOSTLES ARCHIPPUS, PHILEMON AND APPHIA\n\nArchippus was one of the Seventy Apostles. The Apostle Paul mentions him in his Epistle to the Colossians:\n\nAnd tell Archippus, 'See that you fulfill the ministry that you received in the Lord' (Colossians 4:17) , as well as in his letter to Philemon, calling him our fellow soldier (Philemon 1:2) . The center of Christianity in the town of Colossae was in the home of Philemon. Here Christians gathered for prayer. In writing to Philemon, the Apostle Paul called this the church in thy house (Philemon 1:2) 2. THE VENERABLE DOSITHEUS\n\nDositheus was a disciple of the glorious Abba Dorotheus, who lived in the cenobitic monastic community of the Venerable Seridus, John and Barsanuphius the Great. Dositheus was the kinsman of a general, and he came to Jerusalem to visit the Holy Shrines. Once, while he was gazing upon an icon of the Dread Judgment in a church, a woman clothed in purple attire approached him and began explaining the icon to him. Before parting, she said that if he desired to be saved, he should fast, abstain from meat and pray to God often. This was the All-holy Virgin Theotokos. The heart of the young Dositheus became inflamed, and he desired the life of a monk. Dorotheus received him as his novice [Iskusenik] and ordered him to completely abandon his will and obey his spiritual father. For a few days, he gave him as much as he wanted to eat. After a period of time, Dorotheus cut down his rations by a quarter, and after another period of time again by a quarter, until Dositheus became accustomed to subsisting on the least amount of food. Dorotheus constantly repeated to Dositheus: \"Eating is a habit, and as much as a person is accustomed to eat, that much he will eat.\" Dositheus was saved and glorified by total obedience. He has remained forever an example of monastic obedience and dedication to one's spiritual father. This young saint lived in the sixth century.",
  "hymns": "OBEDIENCE\n\nObedience without murmuring, salvation complete:\nAmong the spiritual this is the first pearl, the most precious stone.\nThis pearl, from Eve's necklace, slipped\nAnd after it followed all the goods, by God, bestowed.\nThe devil says both then and now: \"To God, do not listen\nBut live only according to the thoughts of your mind!\nThus says the devil, who from time immemorial has detested the light.\nThus saying, the disobedient with his noose, he fitted.\nChrist came, and to the people He cried out; the obedient He summoned.\nTo every call, the disobedient did not respond.\nThe scene of Paradise, from Christ's time until now, has repeated itself:\nThe obedient, to Paradise, are raised; the disobedient fall.\nTo his spiritual father, the true monk is obedient;\nHis father, to the Church; the Church, to Christ, her Lord.\nObedience, the reliable path toward salvation\nIs the first light, the first pearl of the spiritual necklace.",
  "reflection": "St. Anthony teaches: \"Just as a man comes forth naked from his mother's womb, so the soul comes forth naked from the body. One soul is pure and bright, a second is soiled by sin, and a third is blackened by many sins.  If a body comes forth from a mother's womb unhealthy, it cannot live. Likewise, a soul, if it does not attain the knowledge of God through good behavior, cannot be saved, neither can it be in communion with God. The organ of bodily sight is the eye; the organ of spiritual sight is the mind. Just as the body is blind without eyes, so the soul is blind without a correct mind and a correct life.",
  "contemplation": "Contemplate the Lord Jesus in the midst of the common people:\n\n1. How with love He taught the people as a parent teaches his children;\n\n2. How the common people received His words, were astonished by His works, and glorifed God;\n\n3. How even today, the common people, free from corruption, receive His words with joy and thanksgiving.",
  "homily": "on testing\n\n\"He that is faithful in that which is least is faithful also in much: and he that is unjust in the least is unjust also in much.... If ye have not been faithful in that which is another man's, who shall give you that which is your own? (Luke 16:10,12)\n\nThis is how the Householder of both the material and spiritual world speaks. Material wealth He calls \"least\" and the spiritual wealth He calls \"much.\" If material wealth is given to a person and he proves himself to be selfish, hardhearted, arrogant, unmerciful and godless, then spiritual wealth cannot be given to him. For if he is unfaithful in small things, he will be unfaithful in great things. When he is unfaithful in the physical, he will be unfaithful in the spiritual.\n\nMan undergoes a test in a foreign world, and if he passes the test he will gain his own world.  If, however, he fails the test, who will give him his world? Man's true world, his homeland, is the heavenly, sublime, divine world. The earthly world, however, is the world of coarseness and corruption: a foreign world for man. But man is sent into this foreign world to complete a test for the sake of his true world, his heavenly homeland.\n\nThes two statements of the Savior are similar in meaning. Oh, how profound and true is their meaning! Just as light disperses darkness, so do these words of the Savior disperse our confusion in relation to these questions: Why are we sent into this life? And what should we do? To whomever is able to read with a pure understanding, everything is said in these two sentences.\n\nTherefore, let us know that God will not bestow the spiritual gifts--the gifts of understanding, faith, love, purity, prophecy, miracle-working, power over demons, discernment, or the vision of the heavenly world--on him who has gambled and used for evil, like the Prodigal Son, the gifts of bodily health, earthly riches, glory and position among men, or knowledge of the material world.\n\nO Lord most gentle, sustain our fidelity toward Thee in that which Thou hast entrusted to us.\n\nTo Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen."
