## Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY MARTYRS ONESIPHORUS AND PORPHYRIUS

These two wondrous men were tortured for the name of Christ in the time of Emperor Diocletian. They were severely beaten, then seared on an iron grate, then tied by their tails to horses and dragged over stones and thorns. Thus they were torn to pieces, and they gave up their holy souls to God. Their relics are buried in Pentapolis.

### 2. VENERABLE JOHN KOLOV

He is numbered among the greatest ascetics of Egypt. Kolov means "the Short," for he was of small stature. He came to Scetis together with his brother Daniel, and with exceeding great zeal he gave himself to ascetic struggle, so much so that his brother Daniel had to moderate him. He was a disciple of Saint Pambo and later a teacher to Saint Arsenius the Great. His fellow disciple under Saint Pambo was also Saint Paisius the Great. Once when he and Paisius were discussing what manner of ascetic struggle to undertake, an angel of God appeared to them and commanded John to remain in his place and teach others, while Paisius was to go into the desert and live as a hermit. To test John's obedience, Saint Pambo commanded him to water a dry stick thrust into the ground until it turned green. Without thought or doubt, John watered this dry wood for three full years, day after day, until indeed, by God's power, that wood turned green and bore fruit. Then Pambo gathered the fruit from that tree, took it to the church and distributed it to the brethren, saying: "Come and taste of the fruit of obedience!" John Kolov had a multitude of disciples. Some of his wise sayings have been preserved. He reposed peacefully and departed to the joy of his Lord.

### 3. VENERABLE MATRONA OF CONSTANTINOPLE

From Perge in Pamphylia. Her marriage to a certain nobleman of Constantinople named Dometian quickly became unbearable to her, so she fled, disguised herself in men's clothing, and under the name Babylas entered the monastery of Saint Bassian in Constantinople. But since her husband ceaselessly searched for her, she was compelled to change many locations, such as Emesa, Sidon, Jerusalem, Beirut, and finally came again to Constantinople. She became a nun at the age of twenty-five and struggled ascetically for seventy-five years. She lived a full one hundred years, and as abbess of a monastery in Constantinople peacefully ended her life and departed to the joy of her Lord in the year 492.

### 4. VENERABLE EUTHYMIUS OF DOCHIARIOU AND HIS DISCIPLE NEOPHYTE

Serbs by origin, and kinsmen of high Byzantine aristocrats. Euthymius was first a companion of Saint Athanasius and steward of his Lavra, and later the founder of Dochiariou Monastery. He reposed peacefully in the year 990. His nephew Neophyte succeeded his uncle as abbot of Dochiariou, multiplied the brotherhood, and built a great church. He reposed at the beginning of the eleventh century.

### 5. SAINT SYMEON THE METAPHRAST

A gifted citizen of Constantinople. He had both secular and spiritual education. He became imperial logothete and first nobleman at the court. Yet he lived purely and blamelessly like a true ascetic. He was distinguished also by great military courage and wisdom in statecraft. For this reason Emperor Leo the Wise greatly esteemed him, and once sent him to Crete to negotiate peace with the Arabs, who at that time had occupied this island. Having successfully completed this mission, he returned to Constantinople, and soon withdrew from the world and worldly affairs. He wrote Lives of the saints, composing one hundred twenty-two new biographies and correcting five hundred thirty-nine biographies. He reposed around the year 960. From his body flowed fragrant and healing myrrh.

### 6. VENERABLE THEOCTISTE OF PAROS

Born on the island of Lesbos, she became a nun at the age of seventeen. Wild Saracens attacked that island and captured all who came into their hands, including Theoctiste with her sister. When the Saracens brought the captives to market on the island of Paros, Theoctiste fled from the crowd and hid herself. She hid herself in the middle of the island in an abandoned church, where she struggled ascetically for thirty-five years. She reposed peacefully in the year 881.

## Hymn of Praise

### SAINT SYMEON THE METAPHRAST

Saint Symeon, called the Metaphrast,
He consecrated to the Church his God-given talent,
He loved the saints, God's friends,
And wondrously described their struggles,
Struggles in spirit, struggles in body,
Struggle in thought and struggle in deed.

He was a faithful friend of God's friends,
Of all men in the world most beloved to God.
He loved those whom God also loves,
Through this he deepened his love toward God.

From love toward God Symeon shone forth,
And like an embroidered carpet wrote the Lives,
That new generations in all four directions
Might feed their souls with wondrous chivalry.

Beholding examples of saintly valor
Following in the footsteps of patristic teaching.
O wondrous is our God among His saints,
O wondrous is the Lord – Creator of angels.

## Reflection

After a long separation, John Kolov visited his friend Paisius and entered into conversation with him. They asked one another what virtue each had acquired in so much time. Paisius said: "The sun never saw me eating." But John Kolov said: "And it never saw me angry." While teaching the brethren in Scetis, Saint John used this parable about the repentant human soul: "In a certain city there lived a beautiful woman, but a harlot, who had many lovers. A certain prince proposed to this woman that he would take her for his wife if she promised him that she would live chastely and faithfully in marriage. She promised. The prince took her into his palace and married her. Learning of this, her former lovers resolved somehow to bring her back to them, to her old way. But they did not dare go before the prince's face, so they went behind the palace and began to whistle. The woman heard the whistling and recognized it. But quickly she stopped up her ears and withdrew into an inner chamber of the palace, and locked the door behind her. Thus she escaped new temptations." Saint John explained this parable thus: the harlot woman is the soul, her lovers are the passions, the prince is Christ, the inner chamber is the heavenly dwelling, the lovers who whistle and entice are the demons. If the soul continually turns away from its passions and takes refuge in God, then both the passions and the demons will be frightened and flee from it.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the appearance of the angel to Paul in the night during the storm (Acts 27), namely:

1. How in the night the angel of God appeared to Paul and told him not to fear, for he would be saved, and all with him;
2. How Paul communicated this to the men on the ship and greatly encouraged them.

## Homily

### on saving grace

**By grace are ye saved** (Eph. 2:5-8).

Who can comprehend and acknowledge that we are saved by grace? That we are saved not by our merits and works but by grace – God's grace – who can comprehend and acknowledge this? Only he can comprehend and acknowledge this who has comprehended and seen on the one side the abyss of death and corruption into which man was cast down by sin, and on the other side the height of honor and glory to which man is raised up in the Heavenly Kingdom, in the immortal world, in the house of the living God – only he can both comprehend and acknowledge this. A certain child was traveling by night, and stumbling and falling from hole to hole, from pit to pit, until at last he fell into a very deep pit, from which he could in no way get out by himself. And when the child gave himself up into the hands of his fate and thought that this was his end, suddenly someone stood above the pit, let down a long rope to the child, and called to him to grab hold and hold fast to the rope. This was a certain king's son, who took the child, washed him and clothed him, and led him into his palace, and set him beside himself. Did this child save himself by his own merit and his own work? Never and in no way. His entire merit is that he grabbed hold of the end of the rope extended to him, and that he held onto the rope. By what, then, was the child saved? By the mercy of the king's son. In the relationship of God toward men, that mercy is called grace. *By grace are ye saved.* The Apostle Paul repeats these words twice in a short span, so that the faithful might know and remember. Let us also know, brethren, and remember that we are saved by grace through the Lord Jesus Christ. We were in the jaws of death, and life has been granted to us in the palace of our God.

O Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, by Thee are we saved. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
