## Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY PROPHET OBADIAH

He was native of the village of Bethacharba in the region of Shechem. He lived at the court of King Ahab; but when the king departed from true worship of God and bowed down to idols, Obadiah did not follow the king's example but continued to serve the one true God. And when the wicked Queen Jezebel raised a persecution against all the prophets of God because of Elijah, Obadiah gathered one hundred of them, hid them in two caves, and fed them to the end (I Kings 18:4). A contemporary of the great prophet Elijah, Obadiah greatly honored Elijah and obeyed him in all things as a follower and disciple. He lived nine hundred years before Christ and reposed peacefully.

### 2. HOLY MARTYR BARLAAM

He was a native of Antioch. For his faith in Christ the Lord he was much interrogated by an impious judge. Finally the judge thought to mock him and to compel him by force of circumstances to offer sacrifice to idols, for which reason he brought him into an idolatrous temple and placed fire on his palm and incense on the fire, thinking that the martyr would be forced by pain to cast the fire with the incense from his hand before the idols, and thus inadvertently cense them. But the heroic soldier of Christ held the fire on his palm without thought of casting it before the idols, until his fingers burned off and fell away and his palm burned through. And thus his martyr's fingers fell to the ground with the fire. "His right hand was stronger than fire," says Saint Basil the Great, "for even if the flame consumed his hand, still the hand held the fire like ash." And Chrysostom writes: "From on high the angels watched, the archangels observed; the scene was magnificent, surpassing in truth human nature. Behold, who would not wish to see a man who struggled yet did not feel what is proper to men, a man who was himself both altar, and sacrifice, and priest?" When his hand burned off, the entire body of the old man Barlaam collapsed to the ground dead, and his soul departed into the eternal rest of the Lord Savior. This most glorious old warrior suffered in the year 304.

### 3. VENERABLE BARLAAM AND PRINCE JOASAPH, the Indian ascetics

Joasaph was a prince, the son of King Abenner. By God's Providence the elder Barlaam visited him, taught him the Christian Faith, and baptized him. After this the elder withdrew to the mountains for ascetic struggle while Joasaph remained to battle with many temptations in the world and to overcome them by God's grace. Finally Joasaph succeeded in bringing his father also to Christ. After King Abenner was baptized he lived four years in great repentance – for he had committed great sins in persecuting Christians – and then ended his earthly life and passed into the better one. The young Joasaph handed over the kingdom to his friend Barachias, while he went into the desert to struggle ascetically for Christ's sake. His only desire on earth was to see once more his spiritual father, the elder Barlaam. And merciful God fulfilled that desire, so that one day Joasaph stood before Barlaam's cave and cried out: Bless me, father! The elder Barlaam struggled ascetically in the desert for seventy years, and lived in all one hundred years. Saint Joasaph in his twenty-fifth year left the kingdom and went into the desert, where he lived thirty-five years. Both had great love for the Lord Jesus; they brought many to the true faith, and passed into the eternal joy of their Lord.

### 4. HOLY MARTYR HELIODORUS

From the city of Magida in Pamphylia. He was tortured for the Christian Faith in the time of Emperor Aurelian. During severe tortures he heard a voice from heaven: "Fear not, I am with thee!" Thrown into a red-hot copper bull, he prayed diligently to God. And God saved him. The red-hot bull cooled at once, and Heliodorus emerged alive. The judge cried out to him that he was performing sorcery. To this the martyr replied: "My sorcery is Christ!" He was beheaded and went to the Lord.

## Hymn of Praise

When Joasaph saw sickness, old age, and death,
He sincerely became ashamed of this life.
– Behold, I too can be so ill,
And old age will bend me so,
And death can come when I expect it not!

In another's suffering I too suffer bitterly.
Is there anyone living who will know the mystery,
Who could show a better life? —
From the dense mountain then Barlaam descended,
To the young prince he spoke the truth.

And the elder told him about the one God,
About the Father who reigns with the Spirit and the Son,
About the creation of the world, about beautiful Paradise,
About the first Adam in Paradise's radiance,
About the accursed sin that brought us death,

About Christ who for us bore the heavy Cross,
About eternal life better than this one,
About the boundless glory of Christ's Kingdom.
When Joasaph heard the wise Barlaam —
The white day dawned for him, – the night's darkness passed.

## Reflection

The elder Barlaam's tale to Joasaph. A certain man was fleeing from a terrible unicorn. Fleeing thus he fell into a certain pit and caught hold of a tree. And just when he thought he was out of danger, he looked down along the tree and saw two mice, one white and the other black, which alternately but unceasingly gnawed at the root of the tree to bite through it and topple it. Looking still deeper he saw a great and terrible dragon which with gaping mouth waited to swallow the man when the tree should be toppled. And he also saw near his very feet four smaller venomous serpents. Looking up along the tree, the man saw on the branches a little honey, and forgetting all the dangers that surrounded him, he reached out his hands to grasp that little sweetness from the tree. The interpretation: the unicorn represents death, which from Adam until now pursues every man to slay him; the pit filled with all dangers is this world; the tree is the path of our life; the white and black mice are the days and nights that alternate in succession and shorten our life; the great and terrible dragon is Hades; the four venomous serpents are the four elements of which the human body is composed; the little honey on the branches of the tree is the little sweetness that this life offers man. O that people would not be captivated by this worthless sweetness and forget the terrible dangers that surround them and drag them into eternal perdition!

## Contemplation

Contemplate the wondrous creation of the world, namely:

1. How God created on the sixth day the cattle and small creatures and beasts according to their kinds;
2. How God saw that it was good.

## Homily

### on the glorification of God because of Christ the Lord

**Unto Him be glory in the Church by Christ Jesus throughout all ages, world without end. Amen** (Eph. 3:21).

Glory to God! Glory to God in the Church! Glory to Him because of Christ Jesus! Glory to Him throughout all generations! Glory to Him forever and ever! Glory befits no one as it befits God. Nor does anyone glorify God as does the Church of God. Christ is the revealer of God; therefore all glory to God must go through Christ the Lord. The Church will endure through all generations and ages until the end of time; the Church is the purest Body of Christ, filled with power, wisdom, and miracle-working; therefore glory to God rises from the Church – from the holy place to the Holy One, from purity to the Pure One. To God the doxology from the Church is most beloved also because in the Church there are many souls and many voices, yet still unanimity and harmony. Let no one, therefore, separate himself from the common glorification of God; and let no one even think that his glorification of God in separateness and isolation is better than the glorification of God in unity and wholeness with all the faithful. It is not true that one member is lost in the multitude, so that his voice is not heard before God. Does not the hand do its work best when it is inseparably bound to the body? So too every member of the body? The same is true with every believer. When he prays in the Church and with the Church (even if he is in the desert he can pray with the Church and in the Church), not separating himself from the Church, he is better both heard and seen before God. His soul finds manifold echo in the souls of the other faithful, so that he stands out more and is more recognizable in his prayer in connection with the Body of the Church than apart from this connection.

O Lord Jesus, only from Thee, in Thee, and through Thee can we glorify God. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
