## LIVES OF THE SAINTS

### 1. Venerable Martyrs Galaction and Episteme
They were from the city of Emesa in Phoenicia, both of pagan parents. Galaction's mother was barren until she was baptized. After this she brought her husband also to the true Faith, and baptized and raised her son Galaction in the Christian Faith. When Galaction came of age for marriage, his good mother Leucippe reposed, and his father betrothed him to a certain maiden Episteme. Galaction would by no means enter into marriage, so he first counseled Episteme to be baptized, and after that to become a monastic together with him. Both withdrew to Mount Publion, Galaction to a men's monastery and Episteme to a women's monastery. And each of the two showed themselves to be a true luminary in their monastery. First in labor, first in prayer, first in humility and obedience, first in love. They did not leave the monastery, nor did they see each other again except before their death. A fierce persecution arose, and the two of them were brought to trial. And when they were mercilessly flogging Galaction, Episteme wept. Then they flogged her also. After this they cut off their hands, then their feet, and finally their heads. Eutolmius took their bodies and buried them honorably. This Eutolmius had been first a slave of Episteme's parents, and later a monk together with Galaction. He also wrote the life of these wondrous martyrs of Christ, who suffered and received crowns in heaven in the year 253.

### 2. Holy Apostles: Patrobas, Hermas, Linus, Gaius, and Philologus
They were from the Seventy Apostles. Patrobas was bishop in Naples; Hermas in Philippopolis (Rom. 14:16); Linus in Rome (II Tim. 4:21), Gaius in Ephesus (Rom. 16:23), Philologus in Sinope (Rom. 15:16). All with love fulfilled the law of Christ and departed into the Kingdom of Christ.

### 3. Saint Jonah, Archbishop of Novgorod
Born in Novgorod, Jonah was orphaned at an early age. A certain God-fearing widow took him and raised him. Seeing him as a boy, Michael the fool-for-Christ of Klopsk said to him prophetically: "Little Ivan, study diligently, for you will be archbishop in this great Novgorod." And indeed, later after the death of Archbishop Euthymius, this Jonah was chosen and consecrated to his place. Jonah was pious and merciful as rarely any mortal man. He raised up churches and monasteries and pastored as a true good shepherd. The see of Metropolitan of Moscow was offered to him, but he declined, pleading old age. He reposed peacefully on November 5, 1570, and departed into the joyful heavenly dwellings. A hundred years after his death there was a great fire in Novgorod. In the midst of the fire, the relics of this saint did not burn; on the contrary, after this they began to manifest healing power and to emit a wondrous fragrance.

## HYMN OF PRAISE

Galaction and with him Episteme
Left the world of passing smoke
Their bodies they crucified to passions
And in spirit ascended to heaven.

Their hearts beat and Christ they remember
With love for Christ they are crucified;
But the torturers' bands came
Galaction to torments is led
Episteme rushed after him:

"Easier, brother," she said to him, "do not hurry!
I was baptized by your hand
So take me with you to torments!
And even if, brother, I am unworthy
For my Christ to die I am willing."

Galaction and with him Episteme
Proclaimed Christ to unbelievers
In cruel torments they expired
To their Christ they gave their souls.
Now in Paradise they live with angels—
Galaction and with him Episteme.

## REFLECTION

What a shadow is to reality, and even less, that is what carnal love is to spiritual love. Brotherhood and sisterhood by blood and flesh is nothing when compared with brotherhood and sisterhood by spirit. Galaction's father had betrothed him to the maiden Episteme. Galaction baptized Episteme, and after that both became monastics. Carnal love in them was replaced by spiritual love, strong as death. So great was Galaction's spiritual love toward Episteme that he never desired to see her with bodily eyes. For spiritual love needs neither body nor meeting. And so great was Episteme's spiritual love toward Galaction that when Episteme heard that Galaction had been taken to torture, she herself ran after him, begging him not to reject her but as a spiritual father and brother to receive her into common torment. And when the merciless torturers were flogging holy Galaction on his naked body, holy Episteme wept. But when they were cutting off their hands and feet for Christ, both rejoiced and glorified God. So great was the power of their love toward Christ the Lord, and so great was their mutual spiritual love with which they loved each other. Truly carnal love is like a colorful butterfly that quickly passes, while spiritual love is lasting.

## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the wondrous action of the Holy Spirit upon those baptized (Acts 19), namely:

1. How Paul, coming to Ephesus, saw people baptized with John's baptism unto repentance;
2. How he laid hands on them, and the Holy Spirit descended upon them;
3. How they were filled with power and spoke in tongues and prophesied.

## HOMILY

### on the exaltation of man through the risen Christ

**Far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: And hath put all things under His feet** (Eph. 1:21).

Behold the height to which God has exalted human nature! For here the word is not about the divine nature of Christ but about the human, not about the eternal Word of God but about the Man Jesus, Whom God raised from the dead and exalted not only above all this visible and mortal world but also above the invisible and immortal, far above all angelic orders and heavenly powers, far above the entire manifest and unmanifest wondrous hierarchy of heaven, far above every created being, known and unknown, and far above every name in both worlds, material and spiritual. Do you see, brethren, how our most glorious Creator fulfilled His promise given to Adam, exiled from Paradise, and repeated still more clearly to Abraham, and repeated much more clearly through the prophets and David! Do you see how the Lord of Hosts began to glorify the human race by glorifying the Man Jesus, in Whom was incarnate the divinity of God the Son of God? As the firstfruits of glory, He first glorified Him, and then in order all those who were numbered among His own and marked by the grace of the Holy Spirit for eternal glory, and inscribed in the Book of Life. Not in vain does the Church sing to the Mother of God: "More honorable than the Cherubim and beyond compare more glorious than the Seraphim." Where the Risen Lord was exalted, there also was exalted His Most Holy Mother of God, as well as His holy apostles, according to His word to His heavenly Father: "Father, I will that they also, whom Thou hast given Me, be with Me where I am" (John 17:24). Such is the boundless consequence of God's descent to earth. Such is the inexpressible fruit of His sufferings.

O Lord Jesus Christ, our Savior, equal only to Thy Father and to the Holy Spirit, help us to the end to extricate ourselves from the nethermost depths of stinking sins and sensual madness. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
