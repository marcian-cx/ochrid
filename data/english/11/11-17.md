## Lives of the Saints

### 1. SAINT GREGORY THE WONDERWORKER, BISHOP OF NEOCAESAREA

Behold: a man of God and a mighty wonderworker, called a second Moses. Born of pagan but notable and wealthy parents, Gregory first studied Greek and Egyptian philosophy, but recognizing its barrenness and insufficiency he turned to Christian teachers, and especially to Origen in Alexandria, with whom he studied for several years and from whom he received baptism. Pure in soul and body, he wished to dedicate himself entirely to Christ God, for which reason he withdrew into the desert, where in arduous struggles he spent a long time. His fame spread everywhere, and Phaedimus, Bishop of Amasea, wished to consecrate him as Bishop of Caesarea. The far-seeing Gregory perceived Phaedimus's intention and hid himself throughout the desert from his emissaries so that they would not find him. Finally Phaedimus consecrated him in a wondrous manner, and Gregory was obliged to accept the office of chief pastor. The Most Holy Theotokos appeared to him with Saint John the Theologian, and by the command of the Theotokos Saint John delivered to him the Symbol of Faith, known by Gregory's name. Who can count all the miracles of this second Moses? He commanded evil spirits, he commanded mountains and waters, he healed all pains and diseases, before persecutors he became invisible, he saw into the distance not only events but also human thoughts. He ended his earthly life in the year 270 in deep old age. When he came as bishop to Caesarea, he found the entire city pagan with only seventeen Christians, and when he departed from this life he left the entire city Christian with only seventeen pagans. Therefore he received a crown of glory from his Lord in the Heavenly Kingdom.

### 2. VENERABLE NIKON OF RADONEZH

Nikon was a disciple and successor in the abbacy of Saint Sergius of Radonezh. When barbarians attacked Russia, he prayed to God to remove the affliction from the Russian people. Then Saint Sergius appeared to him with Peter and Alexis, the reposed Metropolitans of Moscow, and told him not to grieve, for that invasion was happening by God's permission for some good purpose, but that it would pass and peace would again reign. He restored the monastery of the Holy Trinity and served many by his example of asceticism. He reposed on November 17, 1426.

### 3. VENERABLE GENNADIUS OF VATOPEDI

Gennadius was a Vatopedi monk with steward's (economic) duties. In his time an emptied barrel was miraculously filled with oil. This miracle was ascribed to the Most Holy Theotokos, to whom the monastery is dedicated, and particularly to her icon which stood there.

## Hymn of Praise

Holy Gregory, both holy and glorious,
Bright star of the Church, Orthodox champion,
By a very narrow path he ascended to God,
Through sufferings and tears he reached blessedness.

He saved himself, he helped many,
By exemplary life, by word and by miracles,
He helped unbelievers to become believers,
And believers to be pure and Orthodox.

Heaven was open for him,
And into people's secrets he clearly saw;
He received secret teaching from heaven,
By heart with that teaching he portrayed the Trinity,
The divine Trinity, one in essence,
Christ – life-giving both as food and as drink.

As pure dew receives the sun into itself
So pure hearts are a dwelling for heaven.
Holy Gregory, with God's help,
Withstood the moonless idolatrous night,
He baptized pagans, baptized by the thousands,
And went to rest, stood beside his King,
Holy Gregory, pray to God:
That the Orthodox Church may withstand the devil!

## Reflection

The following examples from the life of Saint Gregory show how God guards and saves the righteous from misfortune. Even while he was at the philosophical school in Alexandria, Saint Gregory preserved the purity both of his soul and of his body, as he preserved and guarded it to the end of his life. In this he was an exception among the dissolute youth of that time. This aroused in his companions both envy and hatred. To humiliate Gregory they found and sent a harlot to carry out their malicious scheme. Once when Gregory was standing in a certain square with the most renowned teachers and philosophers, that vile woman approached and began shouting, demanding that Gregory pay her what he supposedly still owed her for impure relations with her. Hearing this, some of the people present were scandalized while others became angry at the shameless woman and began to drive her away. But she began to shout even louder and demand money. The innocent Gregory blushed as any innocent creature would blush before a crude slander, but showed neither anger nor hatred; instead he told a friend beside him to give her as much as she demanded, only that she might depart as soon as possible. The friend obeyed the friend and handed over to the woman the money she demanded. But in that moment God allowed an evil spirit upon the woman, and she fell to the ground, began to writhe and jerk, and gnash with her teeth, and throw foam upon her mouth. Seeing this, all were terrified. And holy Gregory, guileless as a lamb, prayed to God for her, and the woman was healed and stood up. And thus instead of humiliation Gregory gained even greater glory. – Another example: when a fierce persecution of Christians began, Saint Gregory counseled the Christians to hide, and he himself with his deacon took refuge on a certain hill. But the imperial soldiers saw them and set out after them. When they were very close, Gregory prayed to God for help, and God suddenly made them invisible to their persecutors. In vain the soldiers turned about in their vicinity – they could not see them, and so finally returned home without them.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the creation of the world, namely:
1. How on the fourth day God created the greater and lesser lights;
2. How He created the sun to shine by day, and the moon and stars to shine by night.

## Homily

### on the breadth and length and depth and height

**That ye may be able to comprehend with all saints what is the breadth, and length, and depth, and height** (Eph. 3:18)

Behold the fruit of faith and love! Behold the royal gifts which King Christ brings when He dwells in the heart of man. Understanding of saving mysteries; understanding of all that is important for man's life. But that understanding is neither personal nor exceptional, neither individual nor original, but rather it coincides with the understanding of all the saints. For who are the saints if not the rich in faith and love? To them was given understanding of God's mysteries because of their faith and love. Test, therefore, thy understanding against their understanding, and if thou seest a difference, know that thou art in the wrong. But if thy understanding coincides with theirs, it means thou hast attained their measure of faith and love, and it means Christ has dwelt in thy heart. Then thou wilt understand what is the breadth of God's love, by which He encompassed in the plan of salvation both Jews and Gentiles; and what is the length of God's Providence, by which from the beginning He prepared the plan of salvation, then in order through the law and the prophets and many miracles; and what is the depth of Christ's humility, because of which He even descended personally into Hades to save the souls of the righteous; and what is the height of Christ's glory, which as man He received after the completion of His saving work on earth. Like the Cross of Christ, so stands the breadth and length and depth and height, embracing all, explaining all, calling all, caressing all, exalting all.

O Lord Jesus, our good Lord, have mercy on us and save us. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
