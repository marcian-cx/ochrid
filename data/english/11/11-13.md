## Lives of the Saints

### 1. SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM, Patriarch of Constantinople

John was born in Antioch in the year 354 to his father Secundus, a commander, and his mother Anthusa. Studying Greek philosophy, John was disgusted by Greek paganism and embraced the Christian Faith as the only and complete truth. John was baptized by Meletius, Patriarch of Antioch, and after him his parents also received baptism. After the death of his parents, John became a monk and began to struggle ascetically with rigor. Then he wrote the book "On the Priesthood," and then the holy Apostles John and Peter appeared to him, prophesying to him great service, great grace, but also great suffering. When he was to be ordained as a priest, an angel of God appeared simultaneously both to Patriarch Flavian (after Meletius) and to John himself. And when the patriarch was ordaining him, all saw a white radiant dove above John's head. Celebrated for his wisdom, asceticism, and power of speech, John was chosen at the wish of Emperor Arcadius as Patriarch of Constantinople. For six years he governed the Church as patriarch with incomparable zeal and wisdom. He sent missionaries to the pagan Celts and Scythians; he suppressed simony in the Church by deposing many bishops who were simonists; he expanded the Church's merciful activity; he composed the particular order of the Holy Liturgy; he shamed the heretics; he denounced Empress Eudoxia; he expounded Holy Scripture with his golden mind and tongue, and left to the Church many precious books of his homilies. The people celebrated him, the envious hated him, the empress sent him twice into exile. He spent three years in exile, and ended his life on the Day of the Cross, September 14, 407, in the town of Comana in Armenia. Before his death the holy Apostles John and Peter appeared to him again, as did Saint Martyr Basiliscus (May 22), in whose church he received his last communion. "Glory to God for all things!" were his last words, and with those words the soul of the golden-mouthed patriarch was carried into Paradise. Of Chrysostom's relics, his head reposes in the Dormition Cathedral in Moscow, and his body in the Vatican in Rome.

### 2. HOLY MARTYRS ANTONINUS, NICEPHORUS, GERMANUS, AND MANITA

The first three, having once seen how pagans at one of their festivals were worshiping idols with shouting and dancing, came forth fearlessly before the crowd and began to preach the one God in Trinity. The governor of Palestinian Caesarea, where this took place, Firmilian, was so enraged by this action of the three Christians that he immediately commanded that their heads be cut off. Manita was a Christian virgin. She was following the martyrs when they were being led to the place of execution. She too was seized and after cruel interrogations was burned in the fire. All suffered in the year 308 and departed to the eternal joy of the eternal God.

### 3. VENERABLE MARTYR DAMASCENE

Born in Galata in Constantinople, he was first called Diamandi. In his youth he lived immorally, so much so that he even converted to Islam. Then bitter repentance arose in him, and he went to the Holy Mountain, where as a monk he struggled ascetically with rigor for twelve years in the Lavra of Saint Athanasius. But desiring martyrdom for the cleansing of his sin, he went to Constantinople and began to go about the mosques, crossing himself and shouting to the Turks how their faith was false and how Jesus Christ is God and Lord. He was beheaded before the gate of Phanar on November 13, 1681. His relics repose on Halki in the monastery of the Holy Trinity.

## Hymn of Praise

The Church celebrates holy John,
Chrysostom bestowed by God,
Christ's great warrior,
Who is both the Church's pride and glory.

Deep of both heart and mind,
And in speech a golden-stringed harp,
He plunged into the depths of mysteries,
And caught a star-bright pearl;

He rose to heaven's heights,
And made clear divine truths;
History's length he surveyed,
All of it he gave to God's Son,
He revealed to us sinful horrors,
And virtues that adorn man;

He showed us the dearest mysteries,
And all the delights of Paradise most gentle.
Evangelist, interpreter of the Gospel,
And bearer of spiritual joy,
Like an apostle he was zealous for Christ,
To no injustice did he consent;

Like a martyr he received torment,—
Torment is a pledge for salvation —
Christ's servant he showed himself true,
Therefore the Church celebrates Chrysostom.

## Reflection

Punishment and reward! Both of these are in God's hands. But just as this earthly life is only a shadow of the true life in heaven, so punishment and reward here on earth are only a shadow of the true punishment and reward in eternity. The chief persecutors of God's saint Chrysostom were: Theophilus, Patriarch of Alexandria, and Empress Eudoxia. After Chrysostom's martyric death, both of them were struck by severe punishment. Namely: Theophilus went mad, and Empress Eudoxia was driven from the palace by Emperor Arcadius. Eudoxia soon fell ill with an incurable disease, and wounds opened on her body and worms swarmed from the wounds. Such a stench spread from her that it was not easy for a person even to pass along the street in front of her house. Physicians used all the finest fragrances and aromatics and incense, only to somehow suppress the stench from the vile empress, but they had little success in this. Finally the empress died in stench and torments. But even after death God's hand weighed upon her. The coffin with her body shook day and night for a full thirty-four years, until Emperor Theodosius transferred the relics of Saint Chrysostom to Constantinople. And what happened with Chrysostom after death? Reward – a reward such as only God can give. Adelphius, Bishop of Arabia, who received Chrysostom the exile into his home in Cucusus, after Chrysostom's death prayed to God to reveal to him where John's soul was. Once while thus in prayer, Adelphius was as though beside himself, and saw a radiant youth who led him through the heavens and showed him in order the hierarchs, shepherds, and teachers of the Church, calling each by name. But John he did not see there. And the angel of God led him toward the exit from Paradise, and Adelphius was sorrowful. When the angel asked him the cause of his sorrow, Adelphius answered that he was grieved that he did not see his beloved teacher John Chrysostom. The angel answered him: "That one cannot be seen by man while he is in the body, for he is at God's throne, together with the Cherubim and Seraphim."

## Contemplation

Contemplate the wondrous creation of the world (Genesis 1), namely:

1. How in the beginning God created heaven and earth;
2. How the earth was without form and void;
3. How the Spirit of God moved upon the waters.

## Homily

### on the foundation and the cornerstone

**Built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ Himself being the chief corner stone** (Eph. 2:20)

The foundation of the apostles and prophets is, brethren, the life and work of the apostles and prophets. This is the Old and New Testament. Who joins together the apostles and the prophets? Christ the Lord. Without Him neither would the prophet understand the apostle nor the apostle the prophet. But He is the fulfillment of the prophets and the testimony of the apostles. Thus He is the cornerstone which binds together the prophets and the apostles and holds them together, just as cornerstones hold together walls. And the entire Old and New Testament is united in Him, finds meaning in Him, turns around Him, is inspired by Him, is held together by Him – by the Lord Jesus Christ. Where would Gentiles and Jews meet and understand each other if not in Jesus Christ the Lord? Nowhere except in Him. In Him and through Him they are united into one New Man, into one immortal body, into one holy and catholic Church. Both body and soul meet in a higher, holy friendship only through the Lord Jesus. The bond of soul and body was hostile until His coming in the flesh; and that hostility was working toward the destruction of the soul. He reconciled and sanctified both. Thus He became the cornerstone of every immortal and God-pleasing building, whether it concerned an individual man, or a family, or a nation, or the entire human race, or the present, or the past, or the future, or the Old Testament or the New Testament. He is the chief stone in every building, just as He is the Head in the body of God's Church.

O Lord Jesus Christ, Rock of our salvation, have mercy and save us. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
