## LIVES OF THE SAINTS

### 1. Venerable Joannicius the Great
This great spiritual luminary was born in the village of Marikata in the region of Bithynia, of his father Myritricus and his mother Anastasia. As a boy he was a shepherd of sheep. While pasturing the sheep he would often withdraw into solitude and remain the whole day in prayer, having surrounded his flock with the sign of the Cross so that they would not wander away and scatter. After this he was taken into the army, where he displayed miraculous courage, especially in the wars against the Bulgarians. After his military service, Joannicius withdrew to Mount Olympus in Asia, where he became a monk and gave himself entirely to the ascetic struggle, from which he did not depart until his deep old age and his death. He struggled ascetically for over fifty years in various places. He had from God a most abundant gift of wonderworking: he healed all diseases and afflictions, cast out demons, tamed wild beasts, and especially had power over serpents; he walked across water as on dry land, became invisible to people when he desired it, and prophesied future events. He was distinguished by exceeding humility and meekness. In outward appearance he was like a giant, large and powerful. He took a living part in the destiny of the Church of God. During the time of iconoclasm, at first he too had been deceived, but afterward he recovered and became an ardent champion of the veneration of icons. He had a great friendship with Patriarch Methodius of Constantinople. Joannicius lived ninety-four years and reposed peacefully in the Lord in the year 846. A great wonderworker both before and after his death.

### 2. Hieromartyrs Nicander, Bishop of Myra, and Hermas the Presbyter
Both were ordained by the Apostle Titus. They were distinguished by great zeal in the Faith and great diligence in winning unbelievers to Christ the Lord. For this they were accused before a certain judge Libanius, who subjected them to cruel interrogations. They were beaten with stones and dragged over stones; they were imprisoned and starved, and endured many other torments which no mortal man could have endured without special help from God. And the Lord appeared to them in various ways, and sent them His angel when they were cast into a fiery furnace, and the angel cooled the fire for them. Finally they were buried alive in graves by the merciless torturers and covered with earth. But in vain do men kill when the Lord gives life, and in vain do they dishonor whom the Lord glorifies.

## HYMN OF PRAISE

O saint of God, Joannicius
Thou didst find mercy in Christ God
Mercy for us sinners also entreat
The grace of the Holy Spirit.

The people Joannicius served
People and princes with much fervor
Then he withdrew from all, from all
To serve the glory of the heavenly King.

Great soldier Joannicius
For the holy Faith, for pure righteousness
With weeping and toil for half a century
He prayed, he prayed to Christ.

Wealthy and glorious Joannicius
Rich, supremely rich with heavenly power
Battle he waged, singing psalms
Against every dark, deceptive force.

Wondrous saint Joannicius
Many wondrous miracles he wrought.
By Christ's name and by the Cross's power
Demonic plots he mightily destroyed.

## REFLECTION

Mercy is the fruit of faith. Where there is true faith, there is also true mercy. Saint Joannicius was once passing by a certain women's monastery in which, among many nuns, were a certain mother and daughter. Evil spirits assailed the young daughter with carnal temptation, and inflamed lustful passion in her to such a degree that she wanted to leave the monastery to get married. In vain her mother counseled her to remain. The daughter would not even listen. When the mother saw Saint Joannicius, she entreated him also to counsel her daughter not to leave the monastery and not to expose her soul to perdition. Joannicius summoned the maiden and said to her: "Daughter, place your hand upon my shoulder!" The maiden did so. Then the merciful saint prayed to God in his heart that God would deliver the maiden from temptation and that her carnal passion should pass over to him. And so it happened. The maiden was completely calmed and remained in the monastery, and the saint of God went on his way. But as he walked, passionate lust blazed up in him and all his blood boiled as if in fire. He desired to die rather than to give in to the passion. Then catching sight of a certain great serpent, he ran toward it that he might be bitten by it and killed. But the serpent would not bite him. He began to provoke it to bite him, but as soon as he reached it, the serpent died. In that hour the flame of lust also vanished from Joannicius.

## CONTEMPLATION

Contemplate the appearance of the Lord to Paul in a night vision (Acts 18), namely:

1. How the Lord appeared to Paul in Corinth in a night vision;
2. How He said to him not to fear but to preach, for, He said, "I have much people in this city";
3. How Paul obeyed and remained there a year and a half.

## HOMILY

### on heirs of the kingdom through Christ the Lord

**In whom also we have obtained an inheritance** (Eph. 1:11).

All is from the Lord Jesus Christ, all is through the Lord Jesus Christ, all is unto the Lord Jesus Christ. Apart from Him we have neither proper connection nor normal communion with God, nor with men, nor with other creatures. He is our head, He is our mind. Through Him we have also become heirs. Heirs of what? Of the Kingdom of God. Why are Christians often called heirs in the New Testament? An inheritance is always connected with someone's death. One must die in order for another to inherit from him. Christians become heirs even in this life, for the old man dies in them, and in his place comes as heir the new man. He who outlives, he also inherits. When the body dies, the soul outlives it; the soul, therefore, also inherits all that man gathered in the body, whether good deeds for salvation or evil deeds for condemnation. Through the Lord Jesus Christ there is opened to us also that inheritance which the Lord Himself enjoys, that is, the immortal Kingdom of God. We shall inherit that kingdom when we leave the earthly kingdom; when we die to the earth we shall inherit heaven; when we break our covenant with Satan we shall be co-heirs with Christ. O my brethren, consider what a rich inheritance awaits us! Let us only not sell it so cheaply as Esau sold his birthright!

O Lord Jesus Christ, our God and our Savior, have mercy on us to the end and save us. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
