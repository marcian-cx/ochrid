## Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY ARCHANGEL MICHAEL AND THE OTHER BODILESS HEAVENLY POWERS

The angels of God were celebrated by men from deep antiquity. But this celebration often degenerated into worship of angels (IV Kings 23:5). Heretics fabricated all sorts of fables about angels. Some of them regarded angels as gods; others, though not considering them gods, called them creators of the entire visible world. The Local Council of Laodicea, which took place four or five years before the First Ecumenical Council, by its 35th canon rejected the worship of angels as gods and established proper veneration of angels. In the time of Pope Sylvester of Rome and Patriarch Alexander of Alexandria (of the fourth century), this feast of the Archangel Michael and the other Heavenly Powers was established in the month of November. Why in November? Because November represents the ninth month after the month of March. In the month of March is considered to have been the creation of the world. And the ninth month after March was chosen because of the nine orders of angels, who were created first. Saint Dionysius the Areopagite, disciple of the Apostle Paul, that apostle who was raised up to the third heaven, described these nine orders in his book "On the Celestial Hierarchy." These orders are as follows: the six-winged Seraphim, the many-eyed Cherubim and the God-bearing Thrones, Dominions, Powers and Authorities, Principalities, Archangels and Angels. The commander of the entire angelic host is the Archangel Michael. When Satan, Lucifer, fell away from God and drew with him into perdition a portion of the angels, then Michael arose and cried out before the angels who had not fallen: "Let us attend! Let us stand aright, let us stand with fear!" And all the heavenly hosts of the faithful angels thunderously sang: "Holy, holy, holy, Lord of Sabaoth, heaven and earth are full of Thy glory!" (See concerning the Archangel Michael Joshua 5:13-15; Jude 9.) Among the angels there reigns perfect unanimity, concord and love, and moreover complete obedience of the lower orders to the higher orders, and of all together to the holy will of God. Every nation has its guardian angel, and besides this every Christian has his guardian angel. One must always remember that whatever we do, openly or in secret, we do in the presence of our guardian angel. And on the day of the Dread Judgment there will gather all the vast multitude of the holy heavenly angels around the throne of Christ, and before them all will be revealed the deeds, words and thoughts of every man. May God have mercy on us and save us by the prayers of the holy Archangel Michael and the other bodiless heavenly powers. Amen.

## Hymn of Praise

Heavenly chief commanders
Who regard us with care,
Shelter us with your wings,
Surround us with your power.

Armed with God's strength,
Crowned with God's glory,
You bear the flaming sword
To cut down evil demons.

Swiftly, swiftly as rays of light
You fly upon the clouds,
Upon the clouds of matter
Where the battle for God is fought.

Without weariness and without sleep
You hover without ceasing
Over people and creatures,
Over numberless worlds.

Behind you are mighty hosts,
Hosts pure and gracious.
Angels are your army
And by the Creator our brethren.

Commanders of the mighty heaven,
Lead us where we must go—
To the throne of the Most High
Who created us from nothing.

## Reflection

That the angels of God unceasingly commune with this world, Holy Scripture testifies clearly and irrefutably. From Holy Scripture and from Holy Tradition the Orthodox Church has learned the names of the seven chiefs of the angelic powers, namely: Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, Uriel, Salathiel, Jehudiel, Barachiel (in addition some mention an eighth—Jeremiel). Michael in Hebrew means: who is like God, or who is equal to God? Saint Michael has been depicted from the first Christian times as a commander who in his right hand holds a spear with which he tramples Lucifer, Satan, and in his left a green palm branch. At the top of the spear is a linen ribbon with a red cross. The Archangel Michael is considered especially the guardian of the Orthodox Faith and a warrior against religious heresies. Saint Gabriel means—man of God, or strength of God. He is the announcer of God's mysteries, especially the mystery of the Incarnation of God, and of all other mysteries connected with it. He is depicted: in his right hand holding a lantern with a lit candle inside, and in his left a mirror of green jasper stone. The mirror signifies the wisdom of God as a hidden mystery. Saint Raphael means—healing of God, or God the Healer (Tobit 3:17; 12:15). He is depicted: with his right hand leading Tobias, who carries a fish caught in the Tigris, and in his left holding a physician's alabaster jar. Saint Uriel—fire or light of God (III Esdras 3:1; 5:20). He is depicted: in his right hand holding a sword against the Persians, and in his left a fiery flame. Saint Salathiel means intercessor of God (III Esdras 5:16). He is depicted with his face and eyes bowed down, and his hands held at his breast as in prayer. Saint Jehudiel—glorifier of God. He is depicted: in his right hand holding a golden crown, and in his left a triple scourge. Saint Barachiel—blessing of God. He is depicted: bearing white roses in his bosom. Jeremiel—exaltation of God (III Esdras 4:36). He is venerated as the inspirer and awakener of exalted thoughts which raise man to God.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the miraculous revival of Eutychus by the Apostle Paul (Acts 20), namely:

1. How Paul preached at night in a house in Troas;
2. How the youth Eutychus fell asleep and fell from a window on the third floor, and was dead;
3. How Paul went down, embraced him and restored his life.

## Homily

### on how Christ gives life to men deadened by sin

**And you hath He quickened, who were dead in trespasses** (Eph. 2:5).

God first gave life to Christ, first raised Him as man from the grave. And Christ is our Head. In order that the entire race of the faithful might be resurrected, it was necessary first that the Head be resurrected. When the Head was resurrected, then the resurrection of the entire body together with all the organs of the body was assured. The Apostle Paul therefore speaks of our resurrection and glorification as an accomplished fact. God both raised us up together, and made us sit together in heavenly places in Christ Jesus. Together with Christ as man, God raised up us also, who previously were dead in sins, deadened by sins. And not only did He make us worthy of resurrection together with Christ the Lord, but even more: He seated us on a level with the risen Christ in the heavenly heights, above the entire world of bodiless spirits. It was not, brethren, for some ordinary and small matter that God appeared on earth, but for something completely extraordinary and great—exceedingly great. When some earthly king makes a visit to one place in his realm, the grace of his visit is long felt in that place. The King and Lord visited the earth and the human race on earth. And the grace of that visit will be felt until the end of time. That visit for us meant life instead of death, glory instead of shame, nearness to God instead of distance, blessing instead of curse. In a word: resurrection from the dead—eternal reign with Christ in heaven.

O Lord, thanks be to Thee; O Lord glory be to Thee. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
