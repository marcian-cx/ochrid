## Lives of the Saints

### 1. SAINT AMPHILOCHIUS, BISHOP OF ICONIUM

Amphilochius was a compatriot, companion, and friend of Saint Basil the Great and other great saints of the fourth century. He abandoned worldly turmoil early and withdrew into a cave, where as a hermit he lived in ascetic struggle for forty years. It then happened that the episcopal see in Iconium became vacant, and Amphilochius was chosen and consecrated in a wondrous manner as Bishop of Iconium. He was a wonderful pastor and great defender of the pure Orthodox Faith. He participated in the Second Ecumenical Council in the year 381. He zealously fought against the wicked Macedonius, and against the Arians and Eunomius. He personally asked Emperor Theodosius the Great to banish the Arians from every city in the state. The emperor did not fulfill his desire. After several days Amphilochius again appeared before the emperor. When the bishop was led into the reception chamber, the emperor was sitting on the throne, and beside him on the right side sat his son Arcadius, whom Theodosius had taken as co-emperor. Upon entering, holy Amphilochius bowed to Emperor Theodosius, but paid no attention to Arcadius, the emperor's son, as if he were not even there. Emperor Theodosius became very angry because of this and ordered that Amphilochius be immediately driven from the court. Then the saint said to the emperor: "Seest thou, O emperor, how thou dost not endure dishonor to thy son; so also God the Father does not endure dishonor to His Son, turns away with hatred from those who blaspheme Him, and is wroth with all adherents of that accursed (Arian) heresy." Hearing this, the emperor understood why Amphilochius had not shown honor to his son, and marveled at his wisdom and boldness. Among many other labors Saint Amphilochius wrote several books on the faith. He reposed in the year 395 in deep old age and passed into immortal life.

### 2. SAINT GREGORY, BISHOP OF AGRIGENTUM

Gregory was born in Sicily near the city of Agrigentum, where he was later bishop, of pious parents Chariton and Theodotia. His whole life is woven with wondrous miracles of God. In a wondrous manner he went to Jerusalem, in a wondrous manner he was chosen as bishop, in a wondrous manner he was saved from slander. And he himself was a great wonderworker, for he was a great God-pleaser, a great confessor and ascetic. He participated in the Fifth Ecumenical Council in Constantinople. After severe trials he reposed peacefully at the beginning of the seventh century (or end of the sixth).

### 3. SAINT ALEXANDER NEVSKY

Alexander was the son of Prince Yaroslav. From his youth his heart was turned toward God. He defeated the Swedes on the Neva River on July 15, 1240, for which reason he was called Nevsky. On that occasion the saints Boris and Gleb appeared to one of Alexander's commanders and promised their help to the great prince, their kinsman. In the Tatar Golden Horde he refused to bow down to idols or to pass through fire. Because of his wisdom and bodily strength and beauty, even the Tatar khan respected him. He built many churches and performed countless works of charity. He reposed in his forty-third year on November 14, 1263. On November 23 is celebrated the transfer of his relics to the city of Vladimir.

### 4. SAINT MITROPHAN, BISHOP OF VORONEZH

Mitrophan was a glorious Russian hierarch, ascetic, and patriot, and a friend and reprover of Peter the Great. He reposed on November 23, 1703. His wonder-working relics were discovered in 1832.

## Hymn of Praise

Knight of Christ, holy Alexander,
Prince to the people but servant to the Lord,
Ruler of the land, but slave of the Almighty,
This is the whole life of Nevsky.

Outwardly splendor, inwardly weeping,
Outwardly battle, inwardly stillness,
Outwardly illusion, inwardly truth,
Christ was the goal of this hero

Both in war and apparent peace.
In torment, Christ was his joy,
In suffering, Christ was his hope,
In victory, Christ was the victor,

And in death, Christ was the Resurrector.
Christ is everything to him – in both worlds!
He is his lodging, He his life's goal.
The pious prince gave example to the people

How one should serve the Lord.
Holy prince, help us also,
With radiant power, with holy prayers!

## Reflection

God allows misfortune upon the righteous to glorify them all the more. For conquered misfortune most powerfully manifests the glory of God and the glory of the righteous. Holy Gregory of Agrigentum was in all things a righteous man and God-pleaser. But God allowed misfortune upon him similar to the misfortune that once befell Saint Athanasius and Saint Macarius. Namely, two priests, Sabinus and Crescentius, to whom Gregory had done much good, could in no way endure Gregory's virtues. For such is the character of vice, that it can in no way endure virtue. Sabinus and Crescentius, therefore, found a certain public woman, a harlot, and bribed her to slander Gregory, saying that he had relations with her. Once when Gregory was in church, that woman crept into his bedchamber; and when he came from church with the people, that woman appeared from his chamber. Then those two priests began to cry out against Gregory as an adulterer. Gregory was composed and ready for any suffering. They imprisoned him and brought him to Rome. The Pope believed the slanderers and kept Gregory in prison for two and a half years without trial or sentence. Then a council was convened at which Gregory's case was to be decided. But before men could judge, God judged. That woman went mad and was brought before the council as insane. As one senseless she could answer nothing. Gregory the wonderworker prayed to God for her, and she was healed, for the evil spirit came out of her. And she testified through tears that she had been bribed to slander the man of God, and that immediately after that slander the evil spirit had possessed her and held her in its power. And Sabinus and Crescentius, with the other slanderers – over one hundred of them in number – suddenly their faces blackened like charcoal. And the slanderers were punished with exile. Holy Gregory was returned to his diocese and received with great triumph by his people.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the wondrous creation of the world, namely:

1. How God gave to the first people all plants and all fruitful produce for food;
2. How He forbade eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, and this under threat of death.

## Homily

### on grace and gifts

**But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ** (Eph. 4:7)

Behold the principle of difference among Christians. First the apostle enumerated what makes us equal – and that is: one Lord, one faith, one baptism, one God and Father of all – but now he points out what makes us, even beyond our will, unequal. Namely, what makes us unequal is the measure of Christ's gift, according to which the grace of the Holy Spirit is given. Christ is the head of the great body which is called the Church. He builds that body, and separately each member of that body; He is the builder, and He the only one who knows the plan of the building. He does not allow that one member in that building be disproportionately large or disproportionately small. He gives measure to everything and everyone. Thus He apportions to this one five talents, to that one two, and to another one. Let no one be angry and let no one be envious. Let none be angry, for if he has received less he will answer for less; let none be envious, for what someone has more is not his but God's. If he has much, much will be required of him, all as it is said in the divine parable of the talents. O my brethren, let each of us be conscious of the measure of his gift and his responsibility. Let us honor both our own gift and the gift of our neighbor, for all gifts are from God and God's.

O Lord Jesus, great giver of various gifts, to Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
