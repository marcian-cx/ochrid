## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY MARTYR TRYPHON

Tryphon was born in the village of Campsada in Phrygia of poor parents. In childhood he tended geese. And from childhood there was upon him a great grace of God, so that he could heal illnesses in people and in livestock, and cast out evil spirits. At that time Emperor Gordian ruled the Roman Empire, whose daughter Gordiana went out of her mind, and thereby cast her father into great grief. All the physicians could not help the mad Gordiana in any way. Then an evil spirit from the mad maiden spoke and said that no one could cast him out except Tryphon. After many Tryphons from the empire, this young Tryphon too was summoned by God's Providence. He was brought to Rome where he healed the emperor's daughter. The emperor bestowed upon him many gifts, which Tryphon upon his return distributed entirely to the poor. In his village this holy youth continued to tend geese and pray to God. When the Christ-fighting Decius became emperor, Saint Tryphon was tortured and fiercely tormented for Christ. But he endured all the torments with great joy, saying: "O that I might be deemed worthy to perish by fire and torments for the name of Jesus Christ my Lord and God!" All the torments did him no harm, and the torturers finally condemned him to beheading by the sword. Before death Tryphon prayed to God and gave up his soul to his Creator in the year 250.

### 2. HOLY MARTYRS PERPETUA, FELICITAS, SATURUS, AND OTHERS WITH THEM

In the time of Emperor Septimius Severus they were all cast into prison as Christians. Saint Perpetua was of noble birth, and she encouraged all the other prisoners in the prison not to be afraid to suffer for Christ. In a dream Perpetua saw a ladder from earth to heaven, all studded with sharp knives, swords, spears, hooks, nails, and other deadly implements. And at the bottom of the ladder lay a terrible serpent. And she saw how Saturus first ran up the ladder to the top unharmed, and from the top called out to Perpetua: Perpetua, I await you, come, but beware the serpent! Encouraged by this Perpetua stepped on the serpent's head, as on the first step, and then in order quickly ran up to the top. And when she reached the top, she entered into heaven and saw the most beautiful heavenly palaces, and was exceedingly joyful. When she told her dream, all the prisoners interpreted that imminent death awaited them, and first Saturus, which quickly came true. First Saturus was killed, then Perpetua, then the others in order. Like lambs slain for Christ, the Lamb of God. They from Christ also received the eternal reward in the kingdom of light. They all suffered for Christ in 202-203.

### 3. VENERABLE PETER THE GALATIAN

In his seventh year he left his parents' home for Christ's sake, and withdrew into the desert. There by fasting and prayer he so perfected himself that he performed many miracles by the power of God's Spirit. Around the year 429 he departed to the eternal kingdom of Christ, in his ninety-ninth year.

## Hymn of Praise

There grew a golden-branched tree  
With three golden branches,  
Upon it white birds,  
White, snow-white.  

Then the birds fell down,  
Down deep,  
The bright golden tree remained,  
The tree high.  

In the depths death and darkness,  
Dark darkness,  
Malice and hunger, grief and woe,  
Folly, confusion.  

Into black pitch the birds  
All plunged;  
Never more could they  
Fly upward.  

The golden tree took pity  
On the poor birds,  
And a secret conversation arose  
Among the branches.  

Then bent one whole branch  
To the terrible abyss,  
And lifted the flock of birds  
Up to the mountain top.  

Thus Christ, the golden branch,  
Bent to earth  
And lifted the fallen people  
To the glory of the Trinity.  

And now grows the golden tree  
With three golden branches,  
Upon it are white birds,  
White, snow-white.

## Reflection

The prayer of Saint Tryphon before death: "O Lord God of gods and King of kings, Most Holy of all the holy ones, I thank Thee that Thou hast deemed me worthy to complete my struggle without wavering. And now I pray Thee, that the hand of the invisible demon not touch me, that it not drag me into the depths of perdition. But let Thy holy angels lead me into Thy beautiful dwellings, and make me an heir of Thy desired kingdom. Receive my soul, and hear the prayer of all those who will offer sacrifices to Thee in my remembrance; look upon them from Thy holy dwelling place; grant them abundant and imperishable gifts. For Thou art the only good and merciful Giver forever and ever, amen." Since Saint Tryphon suffered in Nicaea, and since many miraculous healings occurred over his dead body, the citizens of Nicaea wanted to bury him there in their cemetery. But the saint appeared to someone in a vision and expressed his desire that they transfer him to his village of Campsada where he once tended geese, and bury him there.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as fresh and healthy air for the soul, namely:
1. As fresh and healthy air, which the soul breathes and is saved from corruption;
2. As fresh and healthy air, which the prophets, apostles and saints breathed and were healthy in soul;
3. As fresh and healthy air of my soul, which drives out the stench of sin in me and makes me fresh and healthy spiritually.

## Homily

### on the word of God which like fire cleanses

**Now ye are clean through the word which I have spoken unto you** (John 15:3)

By the word the Lord created the world, by the word renewed the world, by the word forgave sins, healed illnesses, cast out evil spirits, stilled storms and winds. By His holy word He even now cleanses people, that being cleansed they might bear greater fruit. As vines when they are cut and cleansed. The Lord's word is mighty, for it proceeds from the All-Mighty. By the word of the Lord were the heavens made (Psalm 33:6). The Lord's word is bright as the sun, but when necessary also fiery as the sun, and it burns up everything that goes against the Lord. The Lord's word is sweet as honey, but when necessary also bitter as medicine. The Lord's word is welcome as a friend who knocks on the door just when most needed, but when necessary the Lord's word is as a judge who catches in sin and judges allowing no excuses. The Lord's word is true, righteous, wise, merciful: for this it is so all-powerful. No one and nothing can oppose it either in heaven or on earth. And the word of man is powerful when it is true, righteous, wise and merciful. But just as illness can exhaust and weaken a giant so that he becomes more powerless than a child, so falsehood, unrighteousness, folly and mercilessness enfeeble the word of man so it becomes nothing like the clicking of a fox at the moon. He who spares words, forges them from pure silver. But he who squanders them mercilessly, must mix earth with silver. Thy word, O Lord, is life and truth. Cleanse us by Thy all-powerful word, as Thou didst cleanse the apostles. That we may bear much fruit, and be deemed worthy of Thy kingdom. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
