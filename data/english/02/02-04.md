## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. VENERABLE ISIDORE OF PELUSIUM

Isidore was a native of Egypt; the son of distinguished parents and a relative of the Alexandrian patriarchs Theophilus and Cyril. Having studied all the worldly sciences, he renounced wealth and worldly glory and devoted himself entirely to the spiritual life for the love of Christ. He was a great and zealous defender and interpreter of the Orthodox faith. According to the assertion of the historian Nicephorus, Saint Isidore wrote over ten thousand letters to various persons, in which he reproached some, counseled others, comforted a third group, and taught a fourth: "It is more important to teach virtuous living than eloquent preaching," he writes in one letter. In another he says: "If one wishes virtues to show themselves as great, let him consider them small, and they will indeed show themselves as great." The first and fundamental rule for Isidore was: first do, then teach, following the example of the Lord Jesus. During the time of the persecution of Saint John Chrysostom, when the entire world was divided into two camps, one for and the other against this great pillar of Orthodoxy, Saint Isidore took Chrysostom's side. He wrote to Patriarch Theophilus what a great luminary of the Church Chrysostom was, and begged him to abandon his hatred toward him. He lived long, accomplished much, glorifying Christ God by his life and pen, and departed to the Kingdom of Christ around the year 436.

### 2. VENERABLE NICHOLAS THE CONFESSOR

This saint was from the island of Crete. He came to Constantinople to visit his relative Theodore, abbot of the Studion monastery, and there he remained and became a monk. As a monk Nicholas went through all the labors for the salvation of his soul. During the time of the persecution of the Church by Leo the Armenian, Theodore and Nicholas were fiercely tormented, humiliated, beaten with ox sinews, and finally cast into prison where they were imprisoned for three years. After the death of Saint Theodore, Nicholas became abbot of Studion. Even while still alive he performed miracles by the power of God's grace. Thus: he healed Eudocia, wife of Emperor Basil, and Helena, wife of the patrician Manuel, from illness. To Theophilus Melissenus, a distinguished nobleman whose children did not survive, he blessed the newborn daughter and prophesied that she would live and be fruitful, which came to pass to the joy of the parents. On the very day of his death he summoned the monks and asked them what they lacked. Grain—the monks answered. Then the dying man said: "He who fed Israel in the desert will send you wheat abundantly in three days." And indeed on the third day a ship full of grain sailed up to the monastery, sent by Emperor Basil. He departed to the heavenly kingdom in the seventy-fifth year of his life, on February 4, 868.

### 3. HOLY NEW-MARTYR JOSEPH

Joseph was a native of Aleppo. Forced by the Turks to become a Muslim, Joseph not only refused this, but began to expose the Mohammedan lies and praise the Christian faith. For this he was tortured and beheaded in the year 1686.

## Hymn of Praise

Give sacrifice to God, sacrifice of gratitude,  
O you rich by God's mercy!  
Who is rich in what, let him trade with that,  
Each with his gift let him purchase the Kingdom.  

Who is rich in money, let him give money,  
Who is rich in grain, let him distribute grain:  
To whom wisdom is given, let him teach others,  
To whom strength of hands, let him render services.  

Who knows some craft, let him hold it honorably,  
As God's debtor let him consciously consider himself.  
Who can sing, let him praise God,  
Who doesn't know God, only that one is small.  

What one has received, with that let him serve,  
By mercy toward people to God repay.  
All are not equal, nor have the same,  
But all can give God a pure heart.  

O pure heart, worthy sacrifice.  
For salvation you are the decisive virtue,  
And on the altar your incense rises,  
And faster than all before the Lord arrives.

## Reflection

Impose upon yourself some penance for the sins of other people. If you have condemned or punished someone, impose upon yourself also some penance. This is pleasing to God. The saints knew this mystery, who condemned themselves for the sins of other people. Even non-Christian peoples perceive this mystery. In China there exists this custom: when the executioner beheads a criminal condemned to death, then he approaches the judge and reports that he has executed the sentence. The judge gives him one silver coin for having killed the criminal, and orders that forty lashes be given him for having killed—a man. Christian saints deeply understood the mystery of human sin and injustice. Every human sin had for them as long a history as the distance from us to Adam.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as joy, namely:
1. As joy that cheers the human spirit;
2. As joy that enlivens the entire human spirit;
3. Joy from His name, from His words, from His deeds, from His breath.

## Homily

### on the happiness of little Zacchaeus

**This day is salvation come to this house** (Luke 19:9)

Thus said He whose word is life and joy, and renewal to the righteous. Just as a blackened mountain clothes itself in greenery and flower from the spring breath, so also every man, however withered and blackened by sin, refreshes and rejuvenates from Christ's nearness. For Christ's nearness is like the nearness of some life-giving and fragrant balsam, which restores health, multiplies life, gives fragrance to the soul, and to the thoughts, and to the words. In a word: Christ's distance means decay and death, but His nearness means salvation and life.

This day salvation came to this house, said the Lord upon entering the house of Zacchaeus the sinner. Christ was the salvation that came, and Zacchaeus was the house into which He came. Each of us, brethren, is a house in which sin dwells while Christ is far away, and to which salvation comes when Christ draws near. Whether Christ will draw near to my house and yours depends on us. Behold, He did NOT enter even the house of sinful Zacchaeus of His own accord, but as the most desired guest. Little Zacchaeus climbed a tree, just to see the Lord Jesus with his eyes. He therefore sought Him, he desired Him. And we must seek Him, that we might find Him, and desire Him, that He might draw near to us, and climb high with our spirit, that we might meet His gaze. Then He will visit our house as He visited Zacchaeus's house. And with Him salvation will come.

Draw near to us, O Lord, draw near, and bring to us also Thy eternal salvation. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
