## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY APOSTLE TIMOTHY

Timothy was one of the Seventy Apostles. Born in Lystra of Lycaonia of a Greek father and a Jewish mother. The Apostle Paul praises his mother and grandmother for their unfeigned faith (2 Timothy 1:4-5). In Lystra Timothy met the great Apostle for the first time, and was himself a witness when Paul healed a man lame from birth. Later Timothy was almost a constant companion of Paul, traveling with him through Achaia, Macedonia, Italy and Spain. A great zealot of the faith, an excellent preacher and sweet of soul, Timothy contributed greatly to the spread and establishment of the Christian faith. Paul calls him a true son in the faith (1 Timothy 1:2). After Paul's martyric death, Timothy had Saint John the Evangelist as his teacher. But when Emperor Domitian banished him from Ephesus to the island of Patmos, Timothy remained in Ephesus to serve as bishop. During a certain pagan feast called Catagogium, the pagans, enraged at the Christians, treacherously and in masks attacked Timothy and killed him (around the year 93). His holy relics were later transferred to Constantinople and buried in the Church of the Holy Apostles, beside the grave of Saint Luke the Evangelist and Saint Andrew the First-Called.

### 2. VENERABLE MARTYR ANASTASIUS

Anastasius was a Persian by birth. His pagan name was Magundates. When Emperor Heraclius was at war with the Persians, Magundates fled to the Christians, went to Jerusalem where he was baptized and received the name Anastasius. It was not enough for him that he was baptized, but he also became a monk, that he might wholly give himself to serving the Lord. Besides other struggles he would read very early the lives of the holy martyrs and reading them, he wet the book with tears, himself ardently longing for martyrdom. The Lord at last crowned him with the martyr's crown. He lay long in prison and was bitterly tormented, until Emperor Chosroes pronounced upon him the sentence of death. According to this sentence Anastasius was drowned in water, then after being pulled from the water, the executioner cut off his head and sent it to the emperor. He suffered on January 22, 628 in the city of Bethsaloe, near Nineveh.

## Hymn of Praise

Holy Apostles, warmed by the Spirit,  
Spiritual athletes, illumined by the Spirit,  
By Christ's victory they conquered the world,  
They conquered the world, established the Church.  

Great eagles, they flew powerfully,  
Into sufferings and into death they rushed courageously.  
From everything easily, easily they parted,  
From Christ they could never part.  

Christ's love separated them from everything,  
Christ's love glorified them forever.  
Mocked once by earthly tyrants,  
Now they are crowned with the brilliance of eternal day:  

Ridiculed formerly by earthly sages,  
Now—brothers of angels, and leaders of saints!  
Pray for us, Christ's eagles,  
That Christ may renew us sinners with the Spirit.  

Saint Timothy, star among stars,  
Help us also with your prayers.

## Reflection

The Orthodox Church possesses an inexhaustible treasure in proofs of life after death. Let us cite here one of countless examples, one example which at the same time witnesses both that human souls live after bodily death and that voluntary obedience leads to blessed immortality. When Saint Theodosius the Great founded a monastery, he had at the beginning only seven monks. In order to establish these well in remembrance of death, he ordered that a grave be dug. When the grave was ready, Theodosius stood above the grave, surrounded by the seven, and said: "Behold, children, the grave is ready! Is there anyone among you ready for death, that he might be buried in this grave?" One of them, Basil by name and a priest by rank, fell on his knees and asked Theodosius for blessing to die. Theodosius ordered that memorial services be held for Basil: the third day, the ninth day, and the fortieth day, as is customary for the dead. When the fortieth day memorial was completed, Basil, completely healthy, lay down and died. And he was buried in the new grave. On the fortieth day after his burial, however, Basil appeared one morning among the brethren in the church and sang with them. At first only Theodosius saw him, so he prayed to God that God might open the eyes of the others also. And all the brethren looked and saw Basil among them. One brother, Letius, from joy spread out his arms and wanted to embrace Basil, but he disappeared. And Basil's voice was heard: "Save yourselves, fathers and brethren, save yourselves!"

## Contemplation

Contemplate the unconcern of the Lord Jesus regarding food and clothing, namely:
1. His unconcern for Himself, which He shows in deed;
2. The unconcern about food and clothing which He preaches also to others (Matthew 6:31).

## Homily

### on God's omniscience and providence

**But the very hairs of your head are all numbered** (Matthew 10:30)

Even the hairs of your head are numbered, brethren, much less the days of your life! Do not fear, therefore, that you will die before the appointed time, nor hope that you will be able somehow to prolong your life even one day beyond the will of Him who counts and measures. Let this knowledge teach you meekness and the fear of God.

Even the hairs of your head are numbered, much less your sufferings on earth! Do not fear, therefore, that you will suffer more than the measure. Even less fear that your sufferings will remain forgotten and uncounted by Him who sees all. This knowledge will teach you patience and trust toward your Creator and Provider.

Even the hairs of your head are numbered, much less your friends and enemies on earth! Do not fear, therefore, that you will have either too many friends or too many enemies; neither fear that your enemies will overcome you, nor hope that your friends will defend you. Only take care to have God as your friend, and fear nothing. Behold, He is your only friend who loves you unchangeably.

O Lord, gentle Provider, who knowest the number, measure and time of all things, drive away from us every fear except fear of Thee. That through fear of Thee we may come to pure and holy love toward Thee, our Creator and Benefactor. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
