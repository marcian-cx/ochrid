## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. THE THREE HOLY HIERARCHS

The saints Basil the Great, Gregory the Theologian and John Chrysostom each have their own special day of celebration in the month of January, namely: Basil the Great on January 1, Gregory the Theologian on January 25, and John Chrysostom on January 27 and November 13. And this common feast was established in the eleventh century during the time of Emperor Alexius Comnenus. Once there arose from somewhere a dispute among the people about which of these three was the greatest. Some exalted Basil because of his purity and courage; others exalted Gregory because of his unattainable depth and height of mind in theology; a third group exalted Chrysostom because of his wondrous eloquence and clarity in expounding the faith. And so, some called themselves Basilians, others Gregorians, and a third Johannites. But by God's providence this dispute was resolved for the benefit of the Church and for the even greater glory of the three saints. Bishop John of Euchaita (June 14) had a vision in a dream, namely: first each of these three saints appeared to him separately in great glory and ineffable beauty, and then all three together. Then they said to him: "We are one in God, as you see, and there is nothing contradictory in us... nor is there a first or second among us." The saints further counseled Bishop John to write for them one common service and that one common feast day be appointed for them. Following this wondrous vision the dispute was resolved in such a way that January 30 was appointed as the common feast for all three of these hierarchs. The Greek people consider this feast not only an ecclesiastical one but also their greatest national and school holiday.

### 2. HIEROMARTYR HIPPOLYTUS, BISHOP OF ROME

He suffered for the faith in the time of Claudius. When in Rome the virgin Chrysia was mercilessly tortured for Christ, then Saint Hippolytus interceded for her before the torturers and denounced the torturers. Because of this protest he too was brought to trial, tried and condemned to death after long tortures. They bound both his legs and his hands and drowned him in the sea. With him and Chrysia twenty more martyrs also suffered. Saint Hippolytus suffered in the year 269.

### 3. HOLY MARTYR THEOPHILUS THE NEW

As a commander of Emperor Constantine and Irene he was captured by the Agarenes and held in prison for four years. And when he rejected all Muslim pressures to abandon the Christian faith, he was beheaded by the sword in the year 784 and departed to the Lord.

### 4. SAINT PETER, KING OF BULGARIA

Peter was the son of Simeon, a great venerator of Saint John of Rila. He made the Bulgarian Church independent from Constantinople and preserved Orthodoxy in Bulgaria from the Bogomils. After an unsuccessful war with the Hungarians and Russians he died in the year 976 in the fifty-sixth year of his life.

## Hymn of Praise

Fasting and faith—Basil,  
Theology—Gregory.  
Mercy—Chrysostom,  
Chrysostom, Honey-mouth!  

Workers of one work;  
Three separately—three angels,  
Three together like God one,  
Neither chief nor secondary.  

In eternity all agree.  
Call one—three help.  
Sing one, all three hear,  
Glorify one, three rejoice.  

Three men—one whole,  
Three Hierarchs—one work,  
Three names—one glory,  
For all three—Christ is head.

## Reflection

Behold an example of how emperors seek counsel from saints, how saints avoid vanity and wealth, and how they counsel emperors. The Orthodox Emperor Peter of Bulgaria set out with his retinue up Rila Mountain, driven by an irresistible desire to see Saint John of Rila and benefit from his instruction. And the emperor sent people ahead to announce to the saint. But the saint did not agree to a meeting with the emperor. The grieved emperor sent people again with some edible things and enough gold and a request that the saint write him some counsel. John accepted the edible things but returned the gold, not wishing even to touch it; and he answered the emperor: "If you desire the heavenly kingdom, be merciful as the heavenly Father. Do not trust in unrighteousness and do not be greedy; be meek, quiet, accessible to all. Do not accept praise from your nobles. Let your purple shine with virtues. May the remembrance of death not leave your soul. Humble yourself before the feet of the mother Church; bow your head before her primates that the King of kings, seeing your zeal, may bestow upon you a blessing such as never entered into the heart of man." Having received this letter, the emperor kissed it, and afterward often read it.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as friend of children, namely:
1. As friend of the heavenly angels who like children are innocent, obedient and passionless;
2. As friend of little children on earth who simply and easily believe in God;
3. As friend of the saints who by labor and grace have been cleansed from sin and have become innocent like children.

## Homily

### on how men must be like children in order to be sons of God

**Verily I say unto you, Except ye be converted, and become as little children, ye shall not enter into the kingdom of heaven** (Matthew 18:3)

Thus speaks the Lord, and His word is holy and true. What advantage do children have over adults? They have three advantages: in faith, in obedience, and in guilelessness. A child asks the parent about everything, and whatever the parent answers, it believes its parent. A child is obedient to its parent, and easily submits its will to the parental will. A child is guileless, and although it quickly becomes angry, it also quickly forgives. These three things the Lord requires from all people, namely: faith, obedience and guilelessness. He asks that people believe Him unconditionally, as a child believes its parent; that they be unconditionally obedient toward Him, as a child is obedient to its parent; and that they be guileless in relation to one another, that they not remember evil and not return evil for evil.

Faith, obedience and guilelessness are the main characteristics of a child's soul. In addition to this comes: passionlessness and joy. A child is not silver-loving; a child is not lustful; a child is not glory-loving; it has an eye untroubled by vices, and joy untroubled by cares.

O brethren, who can make us children again? No one except Christ alone. He can make us children again and help our rebirth, namely: by His example, by His teaching, and by the power of His Holy Spirit.

O Lord Jesus, perfect in obedience and guilelessness, eternal youth of the heavenly Father, help us to be as youths in faith in Thee, in obedience toward Thee, and in guilelessness toward one another. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
