## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. VENERABLE EPHRAIM THE SYRIAN

Ephraim was born in Syria of poor parents in the time of Emperor Constantine the Great. He spent his early youth quite turbulently, but suddenly there occurred a change in his soul and he began to burn entirely with love toward the Lord Jesus. He was a disciple of Saint James of Nisibis (January 13). From great divine grace, wisdom poured from his tongue like a honeyed stream, and from his eyes tears flowed constantly. Industrious as a bee, Ephraim constantly either wrote books, or orally instructed the monks in the monastery and the people in the city of Edessa, or else devoted himself to prayer and meditation. His books are numerous, his prayers are beautiful. His most famous is that prayer for Great Lent: O Lord and Master of my life. When they wanted to take him by force to be bishop, he pretended to be mad and began to run through the city of Edessa dragging his garment behind him. Seeing this, the people left him in peace. He was a contemporary and friend of Saint Basil the Great. Saint Ephraim is primarily an apostle of repentance. His writings even today soften many hearts hardened by sin, and return them to Christ. He reposed in deep old age in the year 378.

### 2. VENERABLE ISAAC THE SYRIAN

Isaac was born in Nineveh, and in his youth he practiced asceticism in the monastery of Mar Mattai, near Nineveh. When he became renowned for the holiness of his life and many miracles, he was chosen as Bishop of Nineveh and compelled to accept this rank. But only after five months he left the episcopacy and secretly withdrew to the desert monastery of Rabban-Shabur. He composed many works, of which about one hundred homilies on the spiritual life and asceticism have come down to us, written mostly from his own experiences. Incomparable as a psychologist and guide in the spiritual life. Even such saints as Saint Simeon of the Wondrous Mountain sought his counsel. He reposed in deep old age at the end of the seventh century.

### 3. VENERABLE PALLADIUS, SYRIAN HERMIT

Palladius was a great ascetic and wonderworker. Before his cell there appeared the corpse of a certain rich man, whom robbers had killed and plundered. When Palladius was dragged to court, he, in order to save himself from trouble, prayed to God and by prayer raised the dead man to life. He reposed in the fourth century.

### 4. VENERABLE EPHRAIM OF THE CAVES (+ 1096)

He established the celebration of the transfer of the relics of Saint Nicholas to Bari on May 9.

## Hymn of Praise

In Ephraim's heart burns  
Love toward Christ,  
And Ephraim's tongue speaks  
Gospel wisdom pure.  

Ephraim, honey-bearing bee,  
Ephraim, fruit-bearing rain!  
With repentance Ephraim breathes,  
Repentance with tears he proclaims,  

"Repent!" Ephraim writes  
"The repentant God glorifies!"  
Wondrous leader and teacher,  
Both in life and in books,  

Ephraim—comforter to the sorrowful  
And terrible scourge to the careless,  
Toward others honey of mercy,  
Toward himself sword of severity.  

With Ephraim the Church boasts,  
Angels call him brother,  
This befits Ephraim,  
The tender theologian.  

The Church celebrates its Syrian,  
The glorifier of God's Son.  
Ephraim, honey-bearing bee,  
Ephraim, fruit-bearing rain,  

Day and night prayer warrior,  
Ephraim, mighty monk!  
Toward himself sword of severity,  
Toward others honey of mercy!  

The Church celebrates its Syrian,  
The glorifier of God's Son.

## Reflection

The absence of envy among the saints is an equally astounding and wondrous phenomenon. Not only did the saints not allow envy to seize their hearts, but they strove with all their powers to exalt their companions and diminish themselves. When Saint Hilarion the Palestinian once visited Saint Anthony in Egypt, Saint Anthony exclaimed: "Welcome, Morning Star, star of dawn!" To which Saint Hilarion replied: "Hail to you also, bright pillar, who supports the universe!" When Saint Macarius was praised as a monk, the saint replied: "Forgive me, brethren, I am not a monk, but I have seen monks!" When some said to Saint Sisoes that he had attained Saint Anthony in perfection, Sisoes replied: "If I had only one thought of Anthony's, I would be all like fire!"

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as servant, namely:
1. How He voluntarily descended among men, to be a servant to all;
2. How He refused to no one a good service that was asked of Him;
3. How He invisibly and silently even today as always serves the whole world.

## Homily

### on the Man whom no one knows

**Who art thou? And Jesus saith unto them, The beginning** (John 8:25)

The Lord Jesus is the beginning of creation, the beginning of renewal, the beginning of salvation, the beginning of resurrection and of immortal glory.

Wherever some evil in the world is desired to be uprooted, He is the beginning. Without Him it cannot be done. Wherever some good in the world is desired to be built up, He is the beginning. Without Him it cannot be done.

If it is desired to uproot discord and malice in the family, in the village, in the city, in the whole world, without Him it cannot be done. With Him one must begin. If it is desired to bring in good will, peace, love and harmony in the family, in the village, in the city, in the nation, in the whole world, without Him it cannot be done. He is the beginning.

Why can evil not be uprooted without Christ, nor good planted? Because every evil is from sin, and sins only He can forgive. When He, and only He, forgives sin, then sin is uprooted from the root. And no good can be planted without Him because in Him is the whole treasury of good, all the seed of good. He alone is the sower of good in the field of the world.

The Apostle Paul, who understood all this better than we, says:

I can do all things in Jesus Christ who gives me strength (Philippians 4:13). But without Jesus Christ who can begin to heal himself from evil, to heal others from evil, and to implant good in himself, and to implant good in others? No one, truly no one.

Therefore, brethren, if we are determined to uproot evil in ourselves and in others, and in place of evil to implant good in ourselves and in others, let us begin with the beginning, that is, let us begin with the conqueror of evil and the sower of good—with the Lord Jesus Christ.

O Lord Jesus Christ, be Thou our beginning in every struggle against evil, and in every good deed. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
