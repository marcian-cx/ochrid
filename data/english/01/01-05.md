## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. HIEROMARTYR THEOPEMPTUS AND THEONAS

When Diocletian proclaimed the persecution of Christians, Bishop Theopemptus of Nicomedia was the first who suffered for Christ. He was brought before the emperor, and the emperor threatened him with the death penalty if he would not renounce Christ. To that threat the brave bishop answered the emperor: "It is written: fear not them which kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul. You, O emperor, have power over my body, do with it what you will." He was severely beaten, tormented by hunger and tortured in various ways. Finally the emperor summoned a certain sorcerer, Theonas, to somehow overcome the man of God by sorceries. Theonas dissolved the strongest poison in water and gave it to Theopemptus to drink. Theopemptus made the sign of the cross over the cup and drank the poison. Seeing that his poison did not harm Theopemptus at all, Theonas turned to the emperor and cried out: "I also am a Christian, and I worship the Crucified One." Both were condemned to death: Theopemptus they beheaded with a sword, and Theonas they buried alive in the earth, in the year 298. They suffered honorably and became citizens of the Kingdom of Christ.

### 2. THE HOLY PROPHET MICAH I

Micah was a contemporary of the Prophet Elijah. He foretold to the wicked King Ahab his destruction in war with the Assyrians (I Kings 22; II Chronicles 18). He prophesied everything orally and wrote nothing. There was, however, another Micah who foretold the birth of the Lord in Bethlehem, and wrote a book of prophecy.

### 3. VENERABLE MOTHER SYNCLETICA

Syncletica was of Macedonian origin. Raised in Alexandria. As a wealthy and distinguished maiden she had many suitors, but she rejected them all and fled from her parents' home to a monastery. In the greatest abstinence, vigil and prayer she lived to eighty years. Her instructions to the nuns have always been considered true spiritual pearls, for this righteous one did not arrive at high wisdom through books, but through suffering, affliction, day-and-night meditation and spiritual communion with the higher divine world. She passed in soul to that higher world in the year 350. Saint Syncletica among other things said: "If it is a time of fasting, do not excuse yourself from fasting supposedly because of illness, for behold even those who do not fast fall into the same illnesses." She also said: "Just as treasure that is openly displayed is quickly plundered, so also virtue, when it is proclaimed, is darkened and lost."

### 4. VENERABLE APOLLINARIA

Apollinaria was the daughter of Anthemius, viceroy of the minor emperor Theodosius the Younger. She was his elder daughter, while his younger daughter was insane. Apollinaria did not wish to marry, but betrothed herself in her heart to Christ and withdrew to the Egyptian desert. In male clothing and under the male name Dorotheus, she entered a men's monastery where she practiced asceticism, lifting her spirit unceasingly to God and burning with love for her Creator. Someone advised the imperial viceroy Anthemius to send his insane daughter to the desert fathers, that they might read prayers over her. And by God's providence it came to pass that the elder sister healed her insane sister by powerful prayer. Only when Apollinaria reposed was the secret revealed that she was not male but female. The manly courage of this holy virgin remained an example and encouragement through the centuries to many who think about their salvation. She reposed in the year 470.

## Hymn of Praise

### VENERABLE MOTHERS SYNCLETICA AND APOLLINARIA

For God and for their souls the innocent virgins  
Became faithful followers of Christ.  
Pleasures and luxury and laughter they abandoned  
And to the angelic world raised their souls;

In weak bodies torches enkindled,  
By the Holy Spirit their souls wondrously illumined  
Through the ages they shine and show the way,  
With the holy angels in heaven they rejoice.

Apollinaria and Syncletica,  
In your hearts the Holy Spirit shone,  
He strengthened you, He led you, taught you,  
He wedded you and betrothed you to Christ,

Pray for us, O wondrous ascetics,  
Brave heroines, immortal virgins.

## Reflection

Fruit, fruit, and only fruit does the Lord seek from every living tree that is called a man. Good fruit is a God-loving heart, and evil fruit is a self-loving heart. Everything else that a person has and enjoys, such as: position, power, honor, health, money, learning—all of that is only leaves on the tree. "Every tree which bringeth not forth good fruit is hewn down, and cast into the fire" (Matthew 3:10). Even non-Christian peoples valued good deeds more than beautiful words. How much more must this be the rule for the followers of Christ. At one assembly of the Athenians, at which Spartan delegates were also present, a certain old man walked from bench to bench seeking a place to sit. The Athenians mocked him and did not yield him a place. When the old man approached the Spartans, all jumped to their feet and offered him a place. Seeing this the Athenians praised the Spartans with eloquent praises. To this the Spartans replied: "The Athenians know what is good, but do not do good." He who does good is like a tree that brings good fruit to its master. And the source of good in a person is a good, God-loving heart.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the perfection of the first man, Adam, namely:

1. His power, wisdom and beauty;
2. His nearness to God;
3. The voluntary submission of all nature to the authority of sinless Adam.
    

## Homily

### on our helplessness without Christ the Lord

**Without me ye can do nothing** (John 15:5)

Our Lord did not have the habit of speaking in exaggeration. No one's words in the world are more measured than His. So when He says that we without Him can do nothing, then this must be understood and accepted literally. He is speaking here about good and not about evil; we can do no good without Christ, apart from Christ and contrary to Christ. He is the owner, giver and inspirer of all good. No good stands outside of Him, just as no evil stands in Him. I am the vine, and ye are the branches, He said. What can branches do without the vine? Can they grow and bear fruit? Nothing, except become fuel. A person can think as much as he wishes, but he can never conceive of a single true good which is not in Christ, and which does not flow from Christ. If someone says that he does good and humane deeds apart from Christ, know that his deeds are rotten at the core and corroded, either by vanity or by hidden selfishness. For a person without Christ is the same as a branch without the vine. He Himself told us so. The vine is hidden and not seen, but the branch is seen. Yet both the grapes on the branch and the branch itself depend on the vine. The vine of all good grows from the heart of God the Father and is poured out with the sweetness of the Holy Spirit.

O Lord God, Trinity, have mercy on us and save us! To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
