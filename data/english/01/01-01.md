## Lives of the Saints

### 1. THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

On the eighth day after His Nativity, the divine Infant was brought to the temple and circumcised according to the Law existing in Israel since the time of Abraham. On this occasion, He was given the name Jesus, as the Archangel Gabriel had announced to the Most Holy Virgin. The Old Testament circumcision prefigured the New Testament baptism. The circumcision of the Lord shows that He took upon Himself a true human body and not a phantom one, as heretics later taught concerning Him. The Lord was also circumcised because He desired to fulfill the entire Law, which He Himself had given through the prophets and forefathers. Having fulfilled this ordinance of the Law, He replaced it with baptism in His Church. "For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creature" (Gal. 6:15), proclaims the Apostle. (In the church service, this dominical feast has neither a forefeast nor an afterfeast).

### 2. SAINT BASIL THE GREAT, ARCHBISHOP OF CAESAREA

He was born in the time of Emperor Constantine. While still unbaptized, he studied for fifteen years in Athens, learning philosophy, rhetoric, astronomy, and all the other secular sciences of that time. His fellow students were Gregory the Theologian and Julian, the future apostate emperor. In his mature years, he was baptized in the River Jordan together with his former teacher Evulus. He was Bishop of Caesarea in Cappadocia for nearly ten years, and ended his earthly life having completed fifty years from his birth. A great champion of Orthodoxy, a great torch of moral purity and religious zeal, a great theological mind, a great builder and pillar of God's Church—Basil is most deservedly called the Great. In the church service he is called a bee of Christ's Church, who brings honey to the faithful and with his stinger pierces heretics. Numerous works of this Father of the Church have been preserved: theological, apologetic, ascetical, and canonical; likewise also the Liturgy, which bears his name. This Liturgy is served ten times a year, namely: on January 1st, on the Eve of the Nativity, on the Eve of Theophany, on all Sundays of Great Lent except Palm Sunday, on Great and Holy Thursday, and on Great and Holy Saturday. Saint Basil reposed peacefully on January 1, 379, and departed to the Kingdom of Christ.

## Hymn of Praise

### THE CIRCUMCISION OF OUR LORD GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

### SAINT BASIL THE GREAT

Thou Who gavest the Law to the world and to man,
Thou, O Lawgiver, didst Thyself submit to the Law,
Others by force—Thyself willingly—bound,
Therefore on the eighth day Thou wast circumcised in the flesh.

Having fulfilled the Law, Thou didst replace it with a new one:
The carnal circumcision Thou didst replace with a spiritual one.
That we might cut away impure passions from ourselves
And behold Thee in a pure spirit.

To cut and constrain the will of the flesh with the spirit,
To fulfill Thy will, O Savior, in the spirit—
To this circumcision the saints were taught,
Their fiery example they left to us.

Basil the wondrous, like a radiant torch,
Teaches generations such circumcision.
Glory to Basil, Thy great servant,
Great, for because of Thee he humbled and narrowed himself.
Therefore he became greater, and remained the Great.

## Reflection

Why should we listen to the Church and not to one man who thinks against the Church, even if he be called the greatest thinker? Because the Church was founded by the Lord Jesus Christ, and because the Church is inspired and guided by the Holy Spirit of God. Also because the Church signifies the commonwealth of saints, an orchard of cultivated fruit trees. If one rises up against the commonwealth of saints, it means that he is unholy, so why should we listen to him? "The Church is an enclosure," says the most wise Chrysostom; "if you are inside, the wolf does not enter; but if you go out, the wild beasts will seize you... Do not distance yourself from the Church: nothing is mightier than the Church. The Church is your hope, the Church is salvation. She is higher than the heavens, firmer than stone, broader than the earth; she never grows old, she is ever rejuvenated."

## Contemplation

To contemplate the circumcision of the Lord Jesus, namely:

1. His glory in the heavenly kingdom where the Cherubim serve Him with fear and trembling,

2. His humiliation and abasement in the act of circumcision, intended for sinners,

3. To contemplate my own heart: how much I have circumcised it from sinful thoughts, vices, and passions.

## Homily

on how one must turn away from evil and do good

Depart from evil, and do good (Ps. 33:15)

By these words is expressed all the labor with which we must labor here on earth and in the earth, that is, on this material earth and in this material body. What, then, should our labor be? To acquire two habits: one—to turn away from evil, and the other—to do good. And concerning what is good and what is evil, our conscience tells us incompletely and unclearly, for it is darkened by sin, but the teaching of Christ tells us completely and clearly.

What does our Lord ask of us, brethren? He asks that just as our altars are always turned toward the East, so also our souls should always be turned toward the good. That we leave evil behind our backs, in shadow, in the abyss of oblivion, in the darkness of the past, while we, from year to year, from day to day, reach toward the good: that we think about the good, that we yearn for the good, that we speak of the good, that we do good. The Lord seeks builders and not destroyers. For he who builds the good thereby destroys evil. But he who turns to destroy evil quickly forgets to build the good and becomes a malefactor.

Abhor that which is evil; cleave to that which is good (Rom. 12:9), teaches us the Apostle of Christ. Abhor evil, but do not abhor the man who does evil, for he is sick. If you can, heal the sick man, but do not kill him with your hatred. Cleave to the good, and only to the good, for good is from God, and God is the treasury of all good things.

O Lord most good, teach us to turn away from evil and to do good for the sake of Thy glory and for the sake of our salvation. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
