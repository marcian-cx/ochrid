## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. SAINTS CYRUS AND JOHN, UNMERCENARIES AND WONDERWORKERS

These merciful and wondrous saints were not brothers by blood, but they were brothers in spirit. Cyrus first lived in Alexandria and as a physician healed people both by the power of Christ and by physical medicines. Having learned that illnesses attack people mostly because of sins, he always directed the sick to cleanse their souls from sin by repentance and prayer, that through this they might restore health to the body also. When Diocletian's persecution of Christians began, Cyrus withdrew to Arabia where he received the monastic rank. But just as he had been famous in Alexandria, so he became renowned in Arabia also, and people there too resorted to him for help. Having heard of Cyrus, John, then a Roman officer in Edessa, came to Arabia to see him. Upon meeting, they loved one another as brother loves brother, and remained together to practice asceticism. At that time the torturers were torturing a certain Christian woman Athanasius, with her three daughters in the city of Canopus. Cyrus and John heard of this and came to Canopus to encourage the mother and daughters not to fall away from the faith. And indeed, thanks to the counsels of these saints, Athanasius endured all the torments and with her daughters was killed for Christ. The daughters of Athanasius were called: Saint Theoctista of fifteen years, Theodotia of thirteen years and Eudocia of eleven years. Then the torturers seized Cyrus and John and, after torments and imprisonment, beheaded them with the sword in the year 311. Innumerable miracles were performed by these holy martyrs both in life and after death. Their relics were transferred in the time of Emperor Arcadius to Rome. They are invoked for help especially for insomnia, at the blessing of water, and at the anointing with oil (see June 28).

### 2. HOLY MARTYR TRYPHENA

She voluntarily and courageously endured many torments for Christ. And since she would not renounce the faith, a mad ox was released which gored her and killed her. This happened in the first century. She is invoked for help by mothers who cannot nurse their children.

### 3. VENERABLE NIKITA OF THE CAVES

As a monk, not having obeyed the abbot, he withdrew from the monastery and shut himself in a cell. For disobedience God permitted upon him a great temptation. Once when Nikita was at prayer, the devil appeared to him in the form of a bright angel and said to him: no longer pray, but read books, and I will pray for you! Nikita obeyed, ceased to pray and began to read books. He read only the Old Testament, but the New Testament he could in no way even open, for the demonic power did not allow him this. With the help of the devil he also prophesied, and only evil things—crimes, kidnappings, arsons and other evil deeds, which are known to the devil since he himself participates in them. Finally the holy fathers of the Caves perceived that Nikita had fallen into demonic delusion, and they began to pray to God for him. Nikita returned to himself, perceived the abyss in which he had been, repented bitterly for his disobedience and pride, and set himself on the right path. After long repentance and many tears, God forgave him and bestowed upon him the gift of wonderworking. He reposed in the year 1108.

## Hymn of Praise

Nikita prays to the Creator,  
That the Creator deem him worthy,  
That he might see the Creator:  
"Appear to me, O God, O God!"  

O Nikita, sin drives you  
To ask this of God!  
Be deemed worthy, and you shall behold  
The All-Eternal in eternity.  

The immortal God does not allow  
Mortal eye to behold Him  
And even to the higher world it is dread  
To gaze upon the All-Powerful.  

This life is given to us,  
That we might prepare ourselves by it,  
That worthy only after death  
We might behold the eternal light.  

But Nikita seeks, prays,  
That the Creator deem him worthy,  
That he might see the Creator:  
"Appear to me, O God, O God!"  

Then the devil appeared to him:  
"Worship me!" he said,  
And Nikita quick as can be  
Knelt before him!  

For he thought it was an angel:  
The devil was all in radiance,  
And filled with false radiance  
All of Nikita's chamber.  

O do not tempt God, brother,  
This age is an age of preparation,  
In this age is faith,  
In that one only vision.  

First battle, then victory,  
First suffering, then delight—  
All in its own time comes.

## Reflection

Although the Holy Fathers praised monasticism as an angelic rank; although many of the greatest saints lived out their lives and came to perfection in the desolate and lifeless desert, nevertheless the Orthodox Church does not recommend monasticism to all the faithful. "Not all in the desert were saved, nor did all in the world perish," said a certain saint. To a certain citizen, who even without inclination toward monasticism wanted to go to a monastery, Saint Niphon said: "Child, a place neither saves nor destroys a man, but deeds save or destroy. There is no benefit from a holy place or from a holy rank for one who does not fulfill the commandments of the Lord. Saul lived amid royal splendor—and he perished; David in the same splendor—received the crown. Lot lived among the lawless Sodomites—and he was saved; Judas was among the apostles and went—to Hell. Whoever says that it is impossible to be saved with wife and children, he is deceived. Abraham had a wife and children, and 318 male and female servants, and abundance of gold and silver, yet—he was still called the friend of God. O how many servants of the Church and lovers of the desert were saved! how many nobles and soldiers! how many craftsmen and farmers!... Be pious and man-loving, and you will be saved."

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as master in His own house, namely:
1. How He walks through this world as one who has authority, commanding nature and casting out demons;
2. How He diligently labors upon every man He meets, as a master upon his household;
3. How He behaves in the temple as a master in his home, cleansing the temple from merchants.

## Homily

### against half-heartedness and on the fulfilling of all God's law

**This ought ye to have done, and not to leave the other undone** (Luke 11:42)

Here is meant law and mercy. In the soul of Pharisees and sectarians these two do not stand together, that is, they cannot both keep the prescriptions of the law and show mercy, but disputing about which of these two is more important, they omit one and keep the other. The Pharisees formally strictly kept the legal prescriptions, but had completely abandoned mercy and man-lovingness. Sectarians however flatter themselves that they keep God's righteousness, but completely reject the prescriptions of church laws.

Orthodoxy represents the fullness of faith. It commands that this be done and that the other not be left undone. It is attentive to the external prescriptions of the faith, as a man when he walks among pots and takes care not to break them. But it is even more attentive to the righteousness and mercy of God, as a man who walking among earthen pots values these and guards them not because of the earth from which the pots are made, but because of the precious contents which are in them. Empty pots, which are never filled with any drink, are without value just as are the empty legal forms of the Pharisees. But drink which is poured into the wind is scattered and lost, for it is not poured into vessels designated for it.

And so in Orthodoxy there is no one-sidedness, just as there was none in the Lord Jesus. The Lord says to John the Baptist, who breathes God's righteousness and mercy, that the law must be fulfilled; but to the Pharisees, empty legalists, without God's righteousness and mercy, He says: I will have mercy, and not sacrifice! It is evident that what ought to be done is more important than what ought not to be left undone. But it does not at all mean that what is less important is unnecessary. In the human organism there are much more important and much less important organs, but all of them together make up the human body.

O all-embracing Lord, do not allow us to be one-sided, but help us to fulfill all Thy will. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
