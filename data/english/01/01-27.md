## The Lives of the Saints

### 1. SAINT JOHN CHRYSOSTOM, THE GOLDEN TRUMPET OF ORTHODOXY

The commemoration of this luminary of the Church is celebrated on November 13 and January 30. And on this date is celebrated the transfer of his holy relics from the Armenian village of Comana, where he died as an exile, to Constantinople where he had previously governed the Church as patriarch. When thirty years had passed since his death, Patriarch Proclus delivered a speech in memory of his spiritual father and teacher, and by this speech so enkindled the love of the people and of Emperor Theodosius the Younger toward the great saint, that all desired that Chrysostom's relics be transferred to Constantinople. It is related that the coffin with the relics could in no way be moved from its place until the emperor had written a letter to Chrysostom, asking him for forgiveness (for Theodosius's mother, Eudoxia, had been guilty of persecuting the saint) and calling upon him to come to Constantinople, his former residence. When this penitential letter was placed upon the coffin, the coffin became quite light. During the transfer, many sick people who touched the coffin were healed. When the relics arrived in the capital, then the emperor again prayed over the relics to the saint for forgiveness in the name of his mother, as if she herself were speaking: "While I lived a temporal life, I did you harm, but now when you live an immortal life, be beneficial to my soul. My glory has passed and does not help me at all; help me, O father, in your glory, help me before I am condemned at Christ's Judgment!" When the saint was brought into the Church of the Holy Apostles and placed on the patriarchal throne, then the mass of people heard from his lips the words: "Peace be to all!" The transfer of the relics of Saint John Chrysostom was accomplished in the year 438 (see January 30 and November 13).

### 2. VENERABLE TITUS OF THE CAVES

He was first a soldier, and when in a certain battle he received a wound to the head, he withdrew from the world to the Monastery of the Caves where he was healed and received monasticism. He spent his time in constant lamentation over his former sins. Before his death he was informed through a certain heavenly apparition that all his sins had been forgiven. His relics rest in the Caves of Theodosius.

## Hymn of Praise

Saint John, golden-wrought trumpet,  
Proclaim to men God's mercy,  
Wondrous mercy, which loves even sinners,  
Marvelous mercy, which shines through the sun  

And dazzles the earth with the moon,  
Is cradled in the starry cradle.  
Awesome mercy from bloody Golgotha,  
Where crucified God forgives the world's crime.  

Mercy of awe, forgiveness and glory,  
Mercy which the angels sing,  
Which all creatures drink,  
Which only the saints glorify,  

Mercy which is balm to the sick,  
Joy to the simple, folly to the learned,  
Terror to the proud, punishment to the vain;  

God's mercy, which all creation enjoys,  
Which pours forth like a stream of air,  
Mercy which covers all sins—  

Such mercy unknown until Christ;  
With eternal radiance from Christ it shone.  
O teacher of God's mercy,  
Pray to God to forgive our sins.

## Reflection

Fasting is a great thing, but love is even greater. If by fasting demons are driven out, passions are tamed, the body is calmed, the spirit is ordered, by love God takes up dwelling in man. The Lord Himself emphasized fasting as necessary, but He highlighted love as the chief commandment. In the first half of the last century Dzheladin-bey ruled over Ohrid, a rebel against the sultan and an independent lord, and at that time Metropolitan Kalinik governed the Church. Dzheladin-bey and Kalinik, although of different faiths, were very good friends and often visited one another. It happened that Dzheladin-bey condemned 25 Christians to the gallows. On Great Friday they were to be hanged. The Metropolitan, all agitated because of this case, went to Dzheladin-bey and began to entreat him to lessen the punishment. While they were conversing, the time for lunch arrived, and the bey invited the Metropolitan to dine. For lunch lamb meat had been prepared. The Metropolitan apologized that because of the fast he could not remain for lunch and prepared to leave. The bey felt sorry and said to the Metropolitan: "Choose: either you will eat with me and free 25 people from the gallows, or you will not eat and leave them on the gallows."

The Metropolitan crossed himself and sat down for lunch, and Dzheladin freed the condemned from the death penalty.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the Lord Jesus as high priest:
1. Who offers to God in sacrifice all the time of His life on earth;
2. Who offers to God in sacrifice every word of His, every feeling, every thought, every labor and every tear;
3. Who for men offers to God at last wholly Himself as man.

## Homily

### on the perplexity of the little-faithed

**What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him?** (Matthew 8:27)

Thus questioned the apostles, not yet knowing the Lord Jesus but seeing Him calm the stormy sea and winds. What manner of man is this, that even the winds and the sea obey him? This is He who also created the winds and the sea. What wonder is it, then, that His own creatures obey Him? Is not an axe an obedient tool in those hands which made it? The Lord created all things by the word, therefore all things submit to His word.

Who is This, brethren? This is the very same One who even before this raised up the winds and calmed them, and who stirred up the sea and restrained it. This is the very same One who does this even today. As man He stood before men and rebuked the raging wind and the unbridled sea, that He might destroy the delusion among men, as if the winds and seas move and calm themselves, either by blind chance or by some malicious power, and that He might forever reveal the truth, that the wise and good power of the Creator governs and commands all the elements according to His providence.

Who is This?—asked the apostles. This is the sinless Son of God, O holy apostles, whose name you will carry throughout the whole world, and for whose name you will be tortured and slain like lambs by wolves. Who are the wolves? Those who think that the wind moves of itself, and the sea stirs itself up and calms itself of itself, either of itself or by the devil. O holy apostles, who asked and received a true answer, and proclaimed the truth to the whole world, pray for us, that we all may also be enlightened by this truth.

O Lord, all-wise and all-powerful, calm the winds of sin and still the storm of our passions, foul and unworthy. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
