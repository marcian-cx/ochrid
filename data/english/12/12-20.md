## Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY HIEROMARTYR IGNATIUS THE GOD-BEARER

This holy man was called God-Bearer because Ignatius constantly bore in his heart and on his tongue the name of the living God. And further, according to tradition, Ignatius was called God-Bearer also because Ignatius was taken up in the hands of God incarnate, Jesus Christ. In those days when the Lord was teaching His disciples humility, He took a child and placing him among them, said to them: _Whosoever therefore shall humble himself as this little child, the same is greatest in the kingdom of heaven_ (Matt. 18:4). That child was Ignatius. Later Ignatius was a disciple of Saint John the Theologian, together with Polycarp, Bishop of Smyrna. As bishop in Antioch Ignatius governed the Church of God as a good shepherd, and Ignatius was the first to introduce the antiphonal manner of singing in the church, that is, singing by two choirs so that when the singing on one side ceases, on the other it begins. This manner of singing was revealed to Saint Ignatius among the angels in heaven. When Emperor Trajan was passing through Antioch going to war against the Persians, Trajan learned of Ignatius, summoned him to himself and began to advise that Ignatius offer sacrifice to idols, and Trajan would give him the rank of senator. When both the emperor's counsels and threats remained in vain, Saint Ignatius was bound in irons and in the company of ten merciless soldiers was sent to Rome, to be cast before wild beasts. Ignatius rejoiced at suffering for his Lord and only prayed to God that the wild beasts would be the grave of his body, and that no one would prevent him in that death. After a long and difficult journey from Asia through Thrace, Macedonia and Epirus, Ignatius arrived in Rome, where Ignatius was cast before lions in the circus. The lions tore him apart and devoured him, leaving only a few larger bones and his heart. This glorious lover of the Lord Christ suffered in the year 106 in Rome in the time of the Christ-fighting Emperor Trajan. Ignatius has appeared many times from the other world and performed miracles, helping even to this day everyone who calls upon him for help.

### 2. SAINT DANIEL, ARCHBISHOP OF SERBIA

Daniel was the son of wealthy and God-loving parents. In his youth Daniel was well educated. King Milutin took him to his court, but Daniel out of great love for God fled and became a monk at the Konchul Monastery beside the Ibar River. Later Daniel was abbot of Hilandar and suffered much from the plundering Latin crusaders. Daniel was Bishop of Banja, then of Hum, and finally Archbishop of Serbia. From beginning to end Daniel was a strict ascetic. Daniel had the special gift of tears. Daniel reconciled King Dragutin and Milutin, then Milutin and Stefan Dečanski. Daniel fought strongly against the Latins as well as against the Bogomils. Under his supervision the monasteries of Banja and Dečani were built. Daniel restored and built many churches. Daniel wrote the genealogy of the Serbian kings and saints. Tireless in service to God until the end of his life, Daniel reposed peacefully in the time of Emperor Dušan, in the night between December 19 and 20, 1338. A great hierarch, a great ascetic, a great laborer and a great patriot.

## Hymn of Praise

### HOLY HIEROMARTYR IGNATIUS THE GOD-BEARER

Hierarch of Christ, wondrous and exemplary,  
Gracious hierarch and not God-fighting,  
Not of the God-fighters who slew Christ  
But of the God-bearers who loved Christ—

Holy Ignatius, God-bearing man,  
Thee we glorify, of thee we are proud.  
Emperor Trajan offers thee ranks and honors,  
Only if thou wouldst fall before the idols.

Thou didst amaze the emperor, for wouldst not consent,  
Not for the whole empire wouldst betray the Lord.  
To death gladly wentest, O God-bearing father,  
Therefore we glorify thee, of thee we are proud.

Before the wild beasts cast, thou calmly didst wait,  
Rome wants entertainment: with thee plays its game!  
—I am the wheat of God!— thou didst then proclaim—  
The wild beasts grind me, that good bread I become!

And now where is Trajan? Thou art a dweller of paradise,  
A song to the angels, to us thou art a teacher.  
Holy Ignatius, thou who bearest God,  
The bread of life for us from God obtain!

## Reflection

As by an unquenchable flame the holy martyrs were seized by the love of Christ. That love lightened their sufferings and made death sweet. Of Saint Ignatius, Saint Chrysostom says: _He removed the body from himself with such ease as one removes his garment from himself_. Traveling to Rome to his death, Ignatius feared only one thing, namely, that the Christians might somehow prevent him from martyrdom for Christ, whether by prayers to God or by some external means. Therefore Ignatius continually entreated them both in writing and orally not to do this. _Forgive me_, he would say, _I know what is to my benefit. Only now do I begin to be a disciple of Christ, when I desire nothing of the visible or invisible, only to attain Christ. Let all diabolical torments come upon me: fire, cross, wild beasts, cutting, tearing, crushing of bones, dismemberment of the whole body—only to obtain Jesus Christ. It is better for me to die for Christ than to reign to the ends of the earth...My love is nailed to the cross, and in me there is no fire of love toward any worldly thing!_ When Ignatius was led into the circus, he addressed the people with these words: _Citizens of Rome, know that I am not being punished for any crime, nor am I condemned to death for any lawlessness, but for the sake of my God, by whose love I am seized and whom I insatiably desire: I am His wheat, and the teeth of wild beasts will grind me, that I may be His pure bread_. When Ignatius was devoured by the wild beasts, by God's Providence his heart remained among the bones. And when the unbelievers cut open the saint's heart, they saw inside the heart written in golden letters the name: Jesus Christ.

## Contemplation

Contemplate Joshua's courage, namely:

1. How Joshua kept all the Lord's commandments unflinchingly;
2. How with faith in God's help Joshua courageously went into all battles against the enemies of his people;
3. How Joshua conquered everywhere and ascribed all victories to God.
    

## Homily

### on David

**Then said David unto Nathan, I have sinned against the Lord...my tears have been my meat day and night** (2 Sam. 12; Ps. 42)

King David sinned against God, repented, and God forgave him. Great was the king's sin, but still greater his repentance. David was guilty before God of two grave sins, of adultery and murder, but when Nathan, the prophet of God, exposed him, David cried out in anguish: _I have sinned against the Lord!_ David confessed his sin and repented bitterly, most bitterly. And David prayed to God with a broken heart, weeping, fasting, lying on the ground, and meekly enduring the terrible blows which God sent upon him and upon his house and upon his people because of his sin. In his penitential psalms David says: _I am a worm, and no man_ (Ps. 22:6). _My bones cleaved to my skin by reason of my groaning_ (102:5). _I watch_ (v. 7). _I have eaten ashes like bread, and mingled my drink with weeping_ (9). _My knees are weak through fasting_. Here is true repentance, here is a true penitent! David neither hardened in sin, nor fell into despair. But hoping in God's mercy, David repented unceasingly. And God, who loves penitents, had mercy on this exemplary penitent. And God forgave him, and glorified him above all the kings of Israel, and gave him exceedingly great grace to compose the most beautiful penitential prayers, and to prophesy the coming into the world of the Savior of the world, and that from his lineage.

See, brethren, how wondrous is God's mercy toward penitents! So beloved did this penitent David become to God, that God was not ashamed Himself to take upon Himself flesh from his seed. Blessed are those who do not harden in sin, and those who do not fall into despair because of sin. Repentance saves from both evils.

O merciful Lord, soften our hearts with penitential tears. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
