## Lives of the Saints

### 1. HOLY MARTYR SEBASTIAN AND OTHERS WITH HIM

This glorious martyr of Christ was born in Italy and was raised in the city of Milan. In his youth Sebastian gave himself over to military service, and as learned, handsome and brave Sebastian was beloved by Emperor Diocletian, who appointed him as commander of his palace guard. In secret Sebastian confessed the Christian Faith and prayed to the living God. As an honest, just and merciful man, Sebastian was greatly beloved by his soldiers. Wherever he could, Sebastian saved Christians from torment and death, and where he could not, Sebastian encouraged them to die unflinchingly for Christ the living God. Two brothers, Marcus and Marcellinus, who were in prison because of Christ and already on the verge of renouncing Christ and bowing to idols, Sebastian confirmed in the Faith and encouraged for martyrdom. When Sebastian was speaking to them not to fear death for Christ, his face became radiant and all saw his face bright as the face of God's angel. Sebastian confirmed his words with miracles: Sebastian healed Zoe, the wife of the jailer Nicostratus, who had been mute for six years, from muteness, and brought both her and the whole household of Nicostratus to baptism; Sebastian also healed the two sick sons of the general Claudius, and brought Claudius and his household to baptism; Sebastian healed Tranquillinus, the father of Marcus and Marcellinus, of an eleven-year gout and foot disease, and brought him to baptism together with his whole household; Sebastian also healed the Roman eparch Chromatius of the same illness, and brought him and his son Tiburtius to baptism. Of these, holy Zoe suffered first, whom they seized at the tomb of the Apostle Peter where she was praying to God. After torment they cast her into the river Tiber. Then they seized Tiburtius, and the judge set coals before him, telling him to choose life or death, that is, either to cast incense and make offerings to idols, or himself to stand barefoot on the coals. Saint Tiburtius crossed himself and stood barefoot on the coals, and remained unharmed. Then he was beheaded with a sword; Nicostratus was killed with a club; Tranquillinus was drowned in water; Marcus and Marcellinus were tortured and pierced with spears. Then Sebastian was led before Emperor Diocletian. The emperor reproached him for treason, but Sebastian said: _I always pray to my Christ for thy health and for the peace of the Roman Empire_. The emperor commanded that they shoot him naked with arrows. The soldiers shot him with arrows until the whole body of the martyr was covered with arrows, so that he was no longer visible from the arrows. And when all thought that he was dead, Sebastian appeared alive and completely whole. Then the pagans beat him to death with clubs. Sebastian suffered gloriously for Christ his Lord and passed into the Heavenly Kingdom in the year 287, in the time of Emperor Diocletian and Gaius, Bishop of Rome.

### 2. SAINT FLORUS, BISHOP OF AMINUM

Florus lived in the time of Emperors Justin II and Maurice (565-602). Florus was from the nobility and a nobleman. Florus left the tumult and vanity of the world and withdrew to a monastery for ascetic struggle for the salvation of his soul. Then Florus was chosen as bishop of the city of Aminum in the region of Cappadocia. Both as an ascetic and as a hierarch, Florus was pleasing to God and passed peacefully into the Kingdom of God.

### 3. SAINT MODESTUS, PATRIARCH OF JERUSALEM

When his parents died, Modestus was only five months old. But by God's Providence Modestus was raised in the Christian spirit. When Modestus grew up, Modestus was sold as a slave to a certain pagan in Egypt. But Modestus succeeded in converting his master to the Faith of Christ. His master granted him freedom. Modestus withdrew to Mount Sinai, where Modestus struggled in asceticism until his fifty-ninth year. Then Modestus was chosen as Patriarch of Jerusalem. Modestus pastured the flock of Christ as a true shepherd and reposed peacefully in the year 633, in the ninety-seventh year of his life.

## Hymn of Praise

Holy Sebastian covered with arrows,  
In a thicket of arrows his body was clad,  
Under the arrows his soul untouched by anything,  
To heaven his heart lifted up in prayer.

Sebastian endured torments for Christ.  
What are mighty kingdoms, what are many riches,  
Compared to this honor, compared to this splendor—  
To be under arrows because of the living God?

Wondrous Sebastian, this is what he desired:  
For the crucified Savior himself to be crucified,  
By torments and blood to confirm the truth,  
Before heaven and earth to witness the Faith.

The all-seeing Lord who sees all things  
All the drops of his blood measured, numbered,  
And in the eternal kingdom gave him reward,  
Showered him with blessing without measure, without number.

Glorious martyr, who suffered for Christ,  
And by thy suffering increased the Church,  
Pray to God for the Church on earth,  
That she may become ever more beautiful, ever greater.

## Reflection

In this life man is given a choice: either the earthly kingdom or the Heavenly Kingdom. God exerts no pressure on that choice, but each one decides freely. When the brothers Marcus and Marcellinus were condemned to death, the pagan judge left them a month for consideration, either to renounce Christ and His kingdom, or to be executed. Then their kinfolk came to the prison with one counsel, and Saint Sebastian with another. The kinfolk wept and entreated them to comply with the judge's will and spare their youth. The weeping father showed them his gray hair and his illness; the mother adjured them by the food of her breasts with which she had nourished them; their children wept around them. All of them essentially proposed to them that they renounce the Heavenly Kingdom for the sake of the earthly kingdom. But Saint Sebastian counseled them the opposite, saying: _O brave warriors of Christ, will you because of the flattery of your kinfolk lose the eternal crown?...Will you because of women's tears let go the victorious banner?...This life is transitory, and so inconstant and unfaithful that it can never preserve even its lovers. What is this life worth, even if one lives a hundred years? When the last day comes, do not all past years and all earthly pleasures appear as if they never were? Truly it is unreasonable to fear losing this swiftly passing life, when that eternal one will be received, in which pleasure, riches and joy so begin that they never end and remain infinite forever and ever. Remember the Lord's words: a man's foes shall be they of his own household (Matt. 10:36). These are not your friends who separate you from God_. With these and many other words Saint Sebastian prevailed, and the holy martyrs came to love the Heavenly Kingdom more than the earthly kingdom, and joyfully went to death for Christ.

## Contemplation

Contemplate Joseph's chastity (Gen. 39), namely:

1. How the lustful wife of Potiphar drew Joseph to sin;
2. How Joseph rejected her out of fear of God and out of respect for his master;
3. How the woman seized him by his garment, but he left the garment and fled naked with his holy soul.
    

## Homily

### on Ruth

**Thy people shall be my people, and thy God my God...only death will part me from thee** (Ruth 1:16-17)

These words are wonderful when a son says them to his father, and a daughter to her mother, and a wife to her husband. But they are thrice more wonderful when a daughter-in-law says them to her mother-in-law. And these words the blessed Ruth spoke to Naomi, her grieving mother-in-law. When Naomi's two sons died in the land of Moab, where they lived as sojourners, the old mother resolved to return to Bethlehem, her homeland, and there to leave her bones. And Naomi, noble in her grief, counseled her young daughters-in-law to remain in their own land and to remarry. Orpah remained, but Ruth said: _only death will part me from thee_. Here is a beautiful example of how a mother-in-law can tenderly love her daughters-in-law, and again how a daughter-in-law can be wholeheartedly devoted to her mother-in-law. But in Bethlehem someone had to feed these two souls. Who would feed them? God and the industrious hands of Ruth. _Let me go to the field and glean ears of grain_, said the daughter-in-law to the mother-in-law. _Go, my daughter_, answered Naomi. In another's field, behind other reapers, it was necessary to glean ears of grain. This is not only toil, but also shame. But Ruth took upon herself both the toil and the shame out of love for her old mother-in-law. God the All-seeing saw these two sweet souls and rejoiced. Their Creator rejoiced and rewarded them and glorified them, as only He knows how to reward and glorify those who fear Him. And God arranged by His Providence that Ruth went out to the field of the wealthy Boaz to gather grain. And Boaz saw Ruth and proposed to her in Naomi's name. From that marriage was born Obed, the father of Jesse and grandfather of King David. Thus Ruth had humbled herself to the level of a beggar woman, and God made her the ancestress of a great king, from whom came many kings, and finally the King over kings Himself, our Lord Jesus Christ.

O all-seeing Lord, gracious Lord, how wondrous Thou art in Thy providence toward the righteous and merciful. Guide us also and have mercy on us. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
