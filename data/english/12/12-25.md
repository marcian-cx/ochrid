## Lives of the Saints

### 1. THE NATIVITY OF OUR LORD AND GOD AND SAVIOR JESUS CHRIST

*But when the fullness of the time was come, God sent forth His only-begotten Son* (Gal. 4:4), to save the human race. And when nine months were fulfilled from the Annunciation, which the Archangel Gabriel announced to the Most Holy Virgin in Nazareth, saying: *Rejoice, thou that art highly favored...behold, thou shalt conceive in thy womb, and bring forth a son, and shalt call His name Jesus* (Luke 1:28 and 31). At that time there went out a decree from Caesar Augustus that all the world should be enrolled. According to this decree each one had to go to his own city and there be enrolled. Therefore righteous Joseph came with the Most Holy Virgin to Bethlehem, the city of David, for both were of the royal lineage of David. And since much people had gathered in that small city for the enrollment, Joseph and Mary could not find lodging in any house, because of which they took shelter in a certain cave for sheep, where shepherds enclosed their sheep. In that cave, and in the night between Saturday and Sunday, December 25, the Most Holy Virgin gave birth to the Savior of the world, the Lord Jesus Christ. And having given birth to Him without pain, just as she had conceived Him without sin, by the Holy Spirit and not by man, she herself swaddled Him in linen cloths, bowed down to Him as to God and laid Him in a manger. Then righteous Joseph also approached and bowed down to Him as the divine fruit of the virginal womb. Then came also shepherds from the field, directed by God's angel, and they bowed down to Him as Messiah and Savior. And the shepherds heard a multitude of God's angels singing: *Glory to God in the highest, and on earth peace, good will toward men* (Luke 2:14). At that time arrived also three wise men from the East, led by a miraculous star, with their gifts: gold, frankincense and myrrh, and they bowed down to Him as King over kings, and presented Him with their gifts (Matt. 2). Thus came into the world He whose coming was foretold by the prophets, He was born as it was foretold: of the Most Pure Virgin, in the city of Bethlehem, of the lineage of David according to the flesh, at a time when there was no longer in Jerusalem a king from the tribe of Judah, but Herod the foreigner reigned. After His many prefigurations and foreshadowings, envoys and heralds, prophets and righteous ones, wise men and kings, at last He appeared, the Lord of the world and King over kings, to accomplish the work of human salvation which His servants could not accomplish. To Him be eternal glory and praise. Amen.

## Hymn of Praise

From burning love Thou didst descend from heaven,  
From eternal beauty into the ugliness of suffering,  
From eternal light into malicious darkness, thick,  
To those drowning in sin Thou stretchest holy hands.

Heaven was amazed, the earth did tremble:  
Welcome, O Christ! Rejoice, O people!  
From burning love, by which Thou didst create the world,  
As a slave Thou didst humble Thyself, to loose slavery,

To renew the house that Adam destroyed,  
To enlighten the darkened ones, to absolve the sinful.  
Love knows not fear nor humiliation.  
Welcome O Christ, Sovereign of salvation!

From burning love, O King of all beauties,  
Thou didst leave the brilliance of the beautiful cherubim,  
Into the cave didst descend of human life  
With fire and peace to the despairing people.

The earth was frightened: how can it sustain Thee?  
Welcome, O Christ. Thee heaven sustains!  
The most beautiful Virgin long has awaited Thee,  
The earth raises her to Thee that through her Thou descend

From the high throne, from the heavenly city,  
To bring healing, to forgive sins.  
O Virgin of light, golden censer,  
Glory to thee and praise, O gracious mother!

## Reflection

To the Lord Jesus born in Bethlehem first bowed down shepherds and wise men (astrologers) from the East, that is, the simplest and wisest of this world. Even to this day most sincerely bow down to the Lord Jesus, God and Savior, the simplest and wisest of this world. Corrupted simplicity and half-learned wisdom have always been enemies of Christ's Divinity and His Gospel. But who were these wise men from the East? This question was especially studied by Saint Demetrius of Rostov. He maintains that they were kings of certain smaller regions or individual cities in Persia, Arabia and Egypt. At the same time they were great scholars in astrology (astronomy). To them appeared that miraculous star which foretold the birth of the New King. According to Saint Demetrius, that star appeared to them nine months before the birth of the Lord Jesus, that is, at the time of the conception of the Most Holy Theotokos. This period of nine months they spent studying that star, preparing for the journey and traveling. They arrived in Bethlehem soon after the birth of the Savior of the world. One of them was called Melchior. He was old, gray-haired, with long white hair and beard. He brought to the Lord as gift gold. The second was called Gaspar; of ruddy face, young and without beard. He brought to the Lord as gift frankincense. The third was called Balthasar, of black face and very bearded. He brought to the Lord as gift myrrh. Their bodies after death were transferred to Constantinople, from Constantinople to Milan, and from Milan to Cologne. It could be added further that these three wise men were representatives of the three main human races which descended from Noah's sons: Shem, Ham and Japheth. The Persian represented the Japhethites, the Arabian the Semites and the Egyptian the Hamites. So that one can say: through these three the entire human race bowed down to the Incarnate Lord and our God.

## Contemplation

Contemplate the beauty of the soul of the Most Holy Theotokos, namely:

1. How her soul was luminous and immaculate;
2. How her soul was filled with quietness from faith and hope in God;
3. How her soul was filled with fragrant aroma from prayers.
    

## Homily

### on the birth of the Lord the Son of God

**I came forth from the Father, and am come into the world** (John 16:28)

The only-begotten Son of God, brethren, born in eternity from the Father without mother, was born in time from a mother without father. That first birth is the unfathomable mystery of the Holy Trinity in eternity, this second is the unfathomable mystery of the power and love of God for man in time. The greatest mystery in time corresponds to the greatest mystery in eternity. Not entering with the small candle of our reason into this greatest mystery, let us be satisfied, brethren, with the knowledge that our salvation flowed not from man and not from earth but from the highest heights of the divine invisible world. So great is God's mercy and so great is man's dignity, that God the Son Himself descended from eternity into time, from heaven to earth, from the throne of glory into a cave for sheep, only to save people, to purify them from sin, and to restore them to Paradise. *I came forth from the Father*, where I had all, *and am come into the world*, which can give me nothing. The Lord was born in a cave to show that the whole world is one dark cave which He alone can illumine. The Lord was born in Bethlehem—and Bethlehem means house of bread—to show that He is the only bread of life, worthy of true people.

O Lord Jesus, eternal Son of the Living God, and Son of the Virgin Mary, enlighten us and nourish us with Thyself. To Thee be glory and praise forever. Amen.
